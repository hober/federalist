    <h2 class="entry-summary">The Executive Department</h2>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><span class="initial">The</span> constitution of the <a
      href="constitution#a2">executive department</a> of the proposed
      government, claims next our attention. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">There is hardly any part of the system which could have
      been attended with greater difficulty in the arrangement of it
      than this; and there is, perhaps, none which has been inveighed
      against with less candor or criticised with less judgment. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">Here the writers against the Constitution seem to have
      taken pains to signalize their talent of misrepresentation.
      Calculating upon the aversion of the people to monarchy, they have
      endeavored to enlist all their jealousies and apprehensions in
      opposition to the intended President of the United States; not
      merely as the embryo, but as the full-grown progeny, of that
      detested parent. To establish the pretended affinity, they have
      not scrupled to draw resources even from the regions of fiction.
      The authorities of a magistrate, in few instances greater, in some
      instances less, than those of a governor of New York, have been
      magnified into more than royal prerogatives. He has been decorated
      with attributes superior in dignity and splendor to those of a
      king of Great Britain. He has been shown to us with the diadem
      sparkling on his brow and the imperial purple flowing in his
      train. He has been seated on a throne surrounded with minions and
      mistresses, giving audience to the envoys of foreign potentates,
      in all the supercilious pomp of majesty. The images of Asiatic
      despotism and voluptuousness have scarcely been wanting to crown
      the exaggerated scene. We have been taught to tremble at the
      terrific visages of murdering janizaries, and to blush at the
      unveiled mysteries of a future seraglio. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">Attempts so extravagant as these to disfigure or, it
      might rather be said, to metamorphose the object, render it
      necessary to take an accurate view of its real nature and form: in
      order as well to ascertain its true aspect and genuine appearance,
      as to unmask the disingenuity and expose the fallacy of the
      counterfeit resemblances which have been so insidiously, as well
      as industriously, propagated. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">In the execution of this task, there is no man who
      would not find it an arduous effort either to behold with
      moderation, or to treat with seriousness, the devices, not less
      weak than wicked, which have been contrived to pervert the public
      opinion in relation to the subject. They so far exceed the usual
      though unjustifiable licenses of party artifice, that even in a
      disposition the most candid and tolerant, they must force the
      sentiments which favor an indulgent construction of the conduct of
      political adversaries to give place to a voluntary and unreserved
      indignation. It is impossible not to bestow the imputation of
      deliberate imposture and deception upon the gross pretense of a
      similitude between a king of Great Britain and a magistrate of the
      character marked out for that of the President of the United
      States. It is still more impossible to withhold that imputation
      from the rash and barefaced expedients which have been employed to
      give success to the attempted imposition. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">In one instance, which I cite as a sample of the
      general spirit, the temerity has proceeded so far as to ascribe to
      the President of the United States a power which by the instrument
      reported is <em>expressly</em> allotted to the Executives of the
      individual States. I mean <a href="constitution#a2s2c3">the power
      of filling casual vacancies in the Senate</a>. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p7">This bold experiment upon the discernment of his
      countrymen has been hazarded by a writer who (whatever may be his
      real merit) has had no inconsiderable share in the applauses of
      his party<a class="note" href="#note1">1</a>; and who, upon this
      false and unfounded suggestion, has built a series of observations
      equally false and unfounded. Let him now be confronted with the
      evidence of the fact, and let him, if he be able, justify or
      extenuate the shameful outrage he has offered to the dictates of
      truth and to the rules of fair dealing. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p8">The <a href="constitution#a2s2c2">second clause of the
      second section of the second article</a> empowers the President of
      the United States <q cite="constitution#a2s2c2">to nominate, and
      by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to appoint
      ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the
      Supreme Court, and all other <em>officers</em> of United States
      whose appointments are <em>not</em> in the Constitution
      <em>otherwise provided for</em>, and <em>which shall be
      established by law</em>.</q> Immediately after this clause <a
      href="constitution#a2s2c3">follows another</a> in these words: <q
      cite="constitution#a2s2c3">The President shall have power to fill
      up all <em>vacancies</em> that may happen <em>during the recess of
      the senate</em>, by granting commissions which shall <em>expire at
      the end of their next session</em>.</q> It is from this last
      provision that the pretended power of the President to fill
      vacancies in the Senate has been deduced. A slight attention to
      the connection of the clauses, and to the obvious meaning of the
      terms, will satisfy us that the deduction is not even colorable.
      <a class="permalink" href="#p8">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p9">The first of these two clauses, it is clear, only
      provides a mode for appointing such officers, <q>whose
      appointments are <em>not otherwise provided for</em> in the
      Constitution, and which <em>shall be established by law</em></q>;
      of course it cannot extend to the appointments of senators, whose
      appointments are <em>otherwise provided for</em> in the
      Constitution<a class="note" href="#note2">2</a>, and who are
      <em>established by the constitution</em>, and will not require a
      future establishment by law. This position will hardly be
      contested. <a class="permalink" href="#p9">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p10">The last of these two clauses, it is equally clear,
      cannot be understood to comprehend the power of filling vacancies
      in the Senate, for the following reasons: First. The relation in
      which that clause stands to the other, which declares the general
      mode of appointing officers of the United States, denotes it to be
      nothing more than a supplement to the other, for the purpose of
      establishing an auxiliary method of appointment, in cases to which
      the general method was inadequate. The ordinary power of
      appointment is confined to the President and Senate
      <em>jointly</em>, and can therefore only be exercised during the
      session of the Senate; but as it would have been improper to
      oblige this body to be continually in session for the appointment
      of officers and as vacancies might happen <em>in their
      recess</em>, which it might be necessary for the public service to
      fill without delay, the succeeding clause is evidently intended to
      authorize the President, <em>singly</em>, to <a
      href="constitution#a2s2c3">make temporary appointments</a> <q
      cite="constitution#a2s2c3">during the recess of the Senate, by
      granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next
      session.</q> Secondly. If this clause is to be considered as
      supplementary to the one which precedes, the <em>vacancies</em> of
      which it speaks must be construed to relate to the <q
      cite="constitution#a2s2c2">officers</q> described in <a
      href="constitution#a2s2c2">the preceding one</a>; and this, we
      have seen, excludes from its description the members of the
      Senate. Thirdly. The time within which the power is to operate, <q
      cite="constitution#a2s2c3">during the recess of the Senate,</q>
      and the duration of the appointments, <q>to the end of the next
      session</q> of that body, conspire to elucidate the sense of the
      provision, which, if it had been intended to comprehend senators,
      would naturally have referred the temporary power of filling
      vacancies to the recess of the State legislatures, who are to make
      the permanent appointments, and not to the recess of the national
      Senate, who are to have no concern in those appointments; and
      would have extended the duration in office of the temporary
      senators to the next session of the legislature of the State, in
      whose representation the vacancies had happened, instead of making
      it to expire at the end of the ensuing session of the national
      Senate. The circumstances of the body authorized to make the
      permanent appointments would, of course, have governed the
      modification of a power which related to the temporary
      appointments; and as the national Senate is the body, whose
      situation is alone contemplated in the clause upon which the
      suggestion under examination has been founded, the vacancies to
      which it alludes can only be deemed to respect those officers in
      whose appointment that body has a concurrent agency with the
      President. But lastly, the <a href="constitution#a1s3c1">first</a>
      and <a href="constitution#a1s3c2">second</a> clauses of <a
      href="constitution#a1s3">the third section of the first
      article</a>, not only obviate all possibility of doubt, but
      destroy the pretext of misconception. The former provides, that <q
      cite="constitution#a1s3c1">the Senate of the United States shall
      be composed of two Senators from each State, chosen <em>by the
      legislature thereof</em> for six years</q>; and the latter
      directs, that, <q cite="constitution#a1s3c2">if vacancies in that
      body should happen by resignation or otherwise, <em>during the
      recess of the legislature of any state</em>, the Executive
      <em>thereof</em> may make temporary appointments until the
      <em>next meeting of the legislature</em>, which shall then fill
      such vacancies.</q> Here is an express power given, in clear and
      unambiguous terms, to the State Executives, to fill casual
      vacancies in the Senate, by temporary appointments; which not only
      invalidates the supposition, that the clause before considered
      could have been intended to confer that power upon the President
      of the United States, but proves that this supposition, destitute
      as it is even of the merit of plausibility, must have originated
      in an intention to deceive the people, too palpable to be obscured
      by sophistry, too atrocious to be palliated by hypocrisy. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p10">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p11">I have taken the pains to select this instance of
      misrepresentation, and to place it in a clear and strong light, as
      an unequivocal proof of the unwarrantable arts which are practiced
      to prevent a fair and impartial judgment of the real merits of the
      Constitution submitted to the consideration of the people. Nor
      have I scrupled, in so flagrant a case, to allow myself a severity
      of animadversion little congenial with the general spirit of these
      papers. I hesitate not to submit it to the decision of any candid
      and honest adversary of the proposed government, whether language
      can furnish epithets of too much asperity, for so shameless and so
      prostitute an attempt to impose on the citizens of America. <a
