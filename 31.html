      Concerning the General Power of Taxation
    </h3>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><span class="initial">In disquisitions</span> of every
      kind, there are certain primary truths, or first principles, upon
      which all subsequent reasonings must depend. These contain an
      internal evidence which, antecedent to all reflection or
      combination, commands the assent of the mind. Where it produces
      not this effect, it must proceed either from some defect or
      disorder in the organs of perception, or from the influence of
      some strong interest, or passion, or prejudice. Of this nature are
      the maxims in geometry, that <q>the whole is greater than its
      part; things equal to the same are equal to one another; two
      straight lines cannot enclose a space; and all right angles are
      equal to each other.</q> Of the same nature are these other maxims
      in ethics and politics, that there cannot be an effect without a
      cause; that the means ought to be proportioned to the end; that
      every power ought to be commensurate with its object; that there
      ought to be no limitation of a power destined to effect a purpose
      which is itself incapable of limitation. And there are other
      truths in the two latter sciences which, if they cannot pretend to
      rank in the class of axioms, are yet such direct inferences from
      them, and so obvious in themselves, and so agreeable to the
      natural and unsophisticated dictates of common-sense, that they
      challenge the assent of a sound and unbiased mind, with a degree
      of force and conviction almost equally irresistible. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">The objects of geometrical inquiry are so entirely
      abstracted from those pursuits which stir up and put in motion the
      unruly passions of the human heart, that mankind, without
      difficulty, adopt not only the more simple theorems of the
      science, but even those abstruse paradoxes which, however they may
      appear susceptible of demonstration, are at variance with the
      natural conceptions which the mind, without the aid of philosophy,
      would be led to entertain upon the subject. The <em>infinite
      divisibility</em> of matter, or, in other words, the
      <em>infinite</em> divisibility of a <em>finite</em> thing,
      extending even to the minutest atom, is a point agreed among
      geometricians, though not less incomprehensible to common-sense
      than any of those mysteries in religion, against which the
      batteries of infidelity have been so industriously leveled. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">But in the sciences of morals and politics, men are
      found far less tractable. To a certain degree, it is right and
      useful that this should be the case. Caution and investigation are
      a necessary armor against error and imposition. But this
      untractableness may be carried too far, and may degenerate into
      obstinacy, perverseness, or disingenuity. Though it cannot be
      pretended that the principles of moral and political knowledge
      have, in general, the same degree of certainty with those of the
      mathematics, yet they have much better claims in this respect
      than, to judge from the conduct of men in particular situations,
      we should be disposed to allow them. The obscurity is much oftener
      in the passions and prejudices of the reasoner than in the
      subject. Men, upon too many occasions, do not give their own
      understandings fair play; but, yielding to some untoward bias,
      they entangle themselves in words and confound themselves in
      subtleties. <a class="permalink" href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">How else could it happen (if we admit the objectors to
      be sincere in their opposition), that positions so clear as those
      which manifest the necessity of a general power of taxation in the
      government of the Union, should have to encounter any adversaries
      among men of discernment? Though these positions have been
      elsewhere fully stated, they will perhaps not be improperly
      recapitulated in this place, as introductory to an examination of
      what may have been offered by way of objection to them. They are
      in substance as follows: <a class="permalink" href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">A government ought to contain in itself every power
      requisite to the full accomplishment of the objects committed to
      its care, and to the complete execution of the trusts for which it
      is responsible, free from every other control but a regard to the
      public good and to the sense of the people. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">As the duties of superintending the national defense
      and of securing the public peace against foreign or domestic
      violence involve a provision for casualties and dangers to which
      no possible limits can be assigned, the power of making that
      provision ought to know no other bounds than the exigencies of the
      nation and the resources of the community. As revenue is the
      essential engine by which the means of answering the national
      exigencies must be procured, the power of procuring that article
      in its full extent must necessarily be comprehended in that of
      providing for those exigencies. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p7">As theory and practice conspire to prove that the power
      of procuring revenue is unavailing when exercised over the States
      in their collective capacities, the federal government must of
      necessity be invested with an unqualified power of taxation in the
      ordinary modes. <a class="permalink" href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p8">Did not experience evince the contrary, it would be
      natural to conclude that the propriety of a general power of
      taxation in the national government might safely be permitted to
      rest on the evidence of these propositions, unassisted by any
      additional arguments or illustrations. But we find, in fact, that
      the antagonists of the proposed Constitution, so far from
      acquiescing in their justness or truth, seem to make their
      principal and most zealous effort against this part of the plan.
      It may therefore be satisfactory to analyze the arguments with
      which they combat it. <a class="permalink" href="#p8">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p9">Those of them which have been most labored with that
      view, seem in substance to amount to this: <q>It is not true,
      because the exigencies of the Union may not be susceptible of
      limitation, that its power of laying taxes ought to be unconfined.
      Revenue is as requisite to the purposes of the local
      administrations as to those of the Union; and the former are at
      least of equal importance with the latter to the happiness of the
      people. It is, therefore, as necessary that the State governments
      should be able to command the means of supplying their wants, as
      that the national government should possess the like faculty in
      respect to the wants of the Union. But an indefinite power of
      taxation in the <em>latter</em> might, and probably would in time,
      deprive the <em>former</em> of the means of providing for their
      own necessities; and would subject them entirely to the mercy of
      the national legislature. As the laws of the Union are to become
      the supreme law of the land, as it is to have power to pass all
      laws that may be <em>necessary</em> for carrying into execution
      the authorities with which it is proposed to vest it, the national
      government might at any time abolish the taxes imposed for State
      objects upon the pretense of an interference with its own. It
      might allege a necessity of doing this in order to give efficacy
      to the national revenues. And thus all the resources of taxation
      might by degrees become the subjects of federal monopoly, to the
      entire exclusion and destruction of the State governments.</q> <a
      class="permalink" href="#p9">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p10">This mode of reasoning appears sometimes to turn upon
      the supposition of usurpation in the national government; at other
      times it seems to be designed only as a deduction from the
      constitutional operation of its intended powers. It is only in the
      latter light that it can be admitted to have any pretensions to
      fairness. The moment we launch into conjectures about the
      usurpations of the federal government, we get into an unfathomable
      abyss, and fairly put ourselves out of the reach of all reasoning.
      Imagination may range at pleasure till it gets bewildered amidst
      the labyrinths of an enchanted castle, and knows not on which side
      to turn to extricate itself from the perplexities into which it
      has so rashly adventured. Whatever may be the limits or
      modifications of the powers of the Union, it is easy to imagine an
      endless train of possible dangers; and by indulging an excess of
      jealousy and timidity, we may bring ourselves to a state of
      absolute scepticism and irresolution. I repeat here what I have
      observed in substance in another place, that all observations
      founded upon the danger of usurpation ought to be referred to the
      composition and structure of the government, not to the nature or
      extent of its powers. The State governments, by their original
      constitutions, are invested with complete sovereignty. In what
      does our security consist against usurpation from that quarter?
      Doubtless in the manner of their formation, and in a due
      dependence of those who are to administer them upon the people. If
      the proposed construction of the federal government be found, upon
      an impartial examination of it, to be such as to afford, to a
      proper extent, the same species of security, all apprehensions on
      the score of usurpation ought to be discarded. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p10">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p11">It should not be forgotten that a disposition in the
      State governments to encroach upon the rights of the Union is
      quite as probable as a disposition in the Union to encroach upon
      the rights of the State governments. What side would be likely to
      prevail in such a conflict, must depend on the means which the
      contending parties could employ toward insuring success. As in
      republics strength is always on the side of the people, and as
      there are weighty reasons to induce a belief that the State
      governments will commonly possess most influence over them, the
      natural conclusion is that such contests will be most apt to end
      to the disadvantage of the Union; and that there is greater
      probability of encroachments by the members upon the federal head,
      than by the federal head upon the members. But it is evident that
      all conjectures of this kind must be extremely vague and fallible:
      and that it is by far the safest course to lay them altogether
      aside, and to confine our attention wholly to the nature and
      extent of the powers as they are delineated in the Constitution.
      Every thing beyond this must be left to the prudence and firmness
      of the people; who, as they will hold the scales in their own
      hands, it is to be hoped, will always take care to preserve the
      constitutional equilibrium between the general and the State
      governments. Upon this ground, which is evidently the true one, it
      will not be difficult to obviate the objections which have been
      made to an indefinite power of taxation in the United States. <a
