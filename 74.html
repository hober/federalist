      The Command of the Military and Naval Forces, and the Pardoning
      Power of the Executive
    </h2>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><span class="initial">The</span> President of the
      United States <a href="constitution#a2s2">is to be</a> the <q
      cite="constitution#a2s2">commander-in-chief of the army and navy
      of the United States, and of the militia of the several States
      <em>when called into the actual service</em> of the United
      States.</q> The propriety of this provision is so evident in
      itself, and it is, at the same time, so consonant to the
      precedents of the State constitutions in general, that little need
      be said to explain or enforce it. Even those of them which have,
      in other respects, coupled the chief magistrate with a council,
      have for the most part concentrated the military authority in him
      alone. Of all the cares or concerns of government, the direction
      of war most peculiarly demands those qualities which distinguish
      the exercise of power by a single hand. The direction of war
      implies the direction of the common strength; and the power of
      directing and employing the common strength, forms a usual and
      essential part in the definition of the executive authority. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2"><q cite="constitution#a2s2c1">The President may <a
      href="constitution#a2s2c1">require the opinion</a>, in writing, of
      the principal officer in each of the executive departments, upon
      any subject relating to the duties of their respective
      officers.</q> This I consider as a mere redundancy in the plan, as
      the right for which it provides would result of itself from the
      office. <a class="permalink" href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">He is also to be <a
      href="constitution#a2s2c1">authorized to grant</a> <q
      cite="constitution#a2s2c1">reprieves and pardons for offenses
      against the United States, <em>except in cases of
      impeachment</em>.</q> Humanity and good policy conspire to
      dictate, that the benign prerogative of pardoning should be as
      little as possible fettered or embarrassed. The criminal code of
      every country partakes so much of necessary severity, that without
      an easy access to exceptions in favor of unfortunate guilt,
      justice would wear a countenance too sanguinary and cruel. As the
      sense of responsibility is always strongest, in proportion as it
      is undivided, it may be inferred that a single man would be most
      ready to attend to the force of those motives which might plead
      for a mitigation of the rigor of the law, and least apt to yield
      to considerations which were calculated to shelter a fit object of
      its vengeance. The reflection that the fate of a fellow-creature
      depended on his sole fiat, would naturally inspire scrupulousness
      and caution; the dread of being accused of weakness or connivance,
      would beget equal circumspection, though of a different kind. On
      the other hand, as men generally derive confidence from their
      numbers, they might often encourage each other in an act of
      obduracy, and might be less sensible to the apprehension of
      suspicion or censure for an injudicious or affected clemency. On
      these accounts, one man appears to be a more eligible dispenser of
      the mercy of government, than a body of men. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">The expediency of vesting the power of pardoning in the
      President has, if I mistake not, been only contested in relation
      to the crime of treason. This, it has been urged, ought to have
      depended upon the assent of one, or both, of the branches of the
      legislative body. I shall not deny that there are strong reasons
      to be assigned for requiring in this particular the concurrence of
      that body, or of a part of it. As treason is a crime levelled at
      the immediate being of the society, when the laws have once
      ascertained the guilt of the offender, there seems a fitness in
      referring the expediency of an act of mercy towards him to the
      judgment of the legislature. And this ought the rather to be the
      case, as the supposition of the connivance of the Chief Magistrate
      ought not to be entirely excluded. But there are also strong
      objections to such a plan. It is not to be doubted, that a single
      man of prudence and good sense is better fitted, in delicate
      conjunctures, to balance the motives which may plead for and
      against the remission of the punishment, than any numerous body
      whatever. It deserves particular attention, that treason will
      often be connected with seditions which embrace a large proportion
      of the community; as lately happened in Massachusetts. In every
      such case, we might expect to see the representation of the people
      tainted with the same spirit which had given birth to the offense.
      And when parties were pretty equally matched, the secret sympathy
      of the friends and favorers of the condemned person, availing
      itself of the good-nature and weakness of others, might frequently
      bestow impunity where the terror of an example was necessary. On
      the other hand, when the sedition had proceeded from causes which
      had inflamed the resentments of the major party, they might often
      be found obstinate and inexorable, when policy demanded a conduct
      of forbearance and clemency. But the principal argument for
      reposing the power of pardoning in this case to the Chief
      Magistrate is this: in seasons of insurrection or rebellion, there
      are often critical moments, when a welltimed offer of pardon to
      the insurgents or rebels may restore the tranquillity of the
      commonwealth; and which, if suffered to pass unimproved, it may
      never be possible afterwards to recall. The dilatory process of
      convening the legislature, or one of its branches, for the purpose
      of obtaining its sanction to the measure, would frequently be the
      occasion of letting slip the golden opportunity. The loss of a
      week, a day, an hour, may sometimes be fatal. If it should be
      observed, that a discretionary power, with a view to such
      contingencies, might be occasionally conferred upon the President,
      it may be answered in the first place, that it is questionable,
      whether, in a limited Constitution, that power could be delegated
      by law; and in the second place, that it would generally be
      impolitic beforehand to take any step which might hold out the
      prospect of impunity. A proceeding of this kind, out of the usual
      course, would be likely to be construed into an argument of
      timidity or of weakness, and would have a tendency to embolden
      guilt. <a class="permalink" href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>
