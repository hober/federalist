      The Alleged Danger From the Powers of the Union to the State
      Governments Considered
    </h2>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><span class="initial">Having</span> shown that no one
      of the powers transferred to the federal government is unnecessary
      or improper, the next question to be considered is, whether the
      whole mass of them will be dangerous to the portion of authority
      left in the several States. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">The adversaries to the plan of the convention, instead
      of considering in the first place what degree of power was
      absolutely necessary for the purposes of the federal government,
      have exhausted themselves in a secondary inquiry into the possible
      consequences of the proposed degree of power to the governments of
      the particular States. But if the Union, as has been shown, be
      essential to the security of the people of America against foreign
      danger; if it be essential to their security against contentions
      and wars among the different States; if it be essential to guard
      them against those violent and oppressive factions which embitter
      the blessings of liberty, and against those military
      establishments which must gradually poison its very fountain; if,
      in a word, the Union be essential to the happiness of the people
      of America, is it not preposterous, to urge as an objection to a
      government, without which the objects of the Union cannot be
      attained, that such a government may derogate from the importance
      of the governments of the individual States? Was, then, the
      American Revolution effected, was the American Confederacy formed,
      was the precious blood of thousands spilt, and the hard-earned
      substance of millions lavished, not that the people of America
      should enjoy peace, liberty, and safety, but that the government
      of the individual States, that particular municipal
      establishments, might enjoy a certain extent of power, and be
      arrayed with certain dignities and attributes of sovereignty? We
      have heard of the impious doctrine in the Old World, that the
      people were made for kings, not kings for the people. Is the same
      doctrine to be revived in the New, in another shape that the solid
      happiness of the people is to be sacrificed to the views of
      political institutions of a different form? It is too early for
      politicians to presume on our forgetting that the public good, the
      real welfare of the great body of the people, is the supreme
      object to be pursued; and that no form of government whatever has
      any other value than as it may be fitted for the attainment of
      this object. Were the plan of the convention adverse to the public
      happiness, my voice would be, Reject the plan. Were the Union
      itself inconsistent with the public happiness, it would be,
      Abolish the Union. In like manner, as far as the sovereignty of
      the States cannot be reconciled to the happiness of the people,
      the voice of every good citizen must be, Let the former be
      sacrificed to the latter. How far the sacrifice is necessary, has
      been shown. How far the unsacrificed residue will be endangered,
      is the question before us. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">Several important considerations have been touched in
      the course of these papers, which discountenance the supposition
      that the operation of the federal government will by degrees prove
      fatal to the State governments. The more I revolve the subject,
      the more fully I am persuaded that the balance is much more likely
      to be disturbed by the preponderancy of the last than of the first
      scale. <a class="permalink" href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">We have seen, in all the examples of ancient and modern
      confederacies, the strongest tendency continually betraying itself
      in the members, to despoil the general government of its
      authorities, with a very ineffectual capacity in the latter to
      defend itself against the encroachments. Although, in most of
      these examples, the system has been so dissimilar from that under
      consideration as greatly to weaken any inference concerning the
      latter from the fate of the former, yet, as the States will
      retain, under the proposed Constitution, a very extensive portion
      of active sovereignty, the inference ought not to be wholly
      disregarded. In the Achaean league it is probable that the federal
      head had a degree and species of power, which gave it a
      considerable likeness to the government framed by the convention.
      The <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycia#Lycian_league">Lycian
      Confederacy</a>, as far as its principles and form are
      transmitted, must have borne a still greater analogy to it. Yet
      history does not inform us that either of them ever degenerated,
      or tended to degenerate, into one consolidated government. On the
      contrary, we know that the ruin of one of them proceeded from the
      incapacity of the federal authority to prevent the dissensions,
      and finally the disunion, of the subordinate authorities. These
      cases are the more worthy of our attention, as the external causes
      by which the component parts were pressed together were much more
      numerous and powerful than in our case; and consequently less
      powerful ligaments within would be sufficient to bind the members
      to the head, and to each other. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">In the feudal system, we have seen a similar propensity
      exemplified. Notwithstanding the want of proper sympathy in every
      instance between the local sovereigns and the people, and the
      sympathy in some instances between the general sovereign and the
      latter, it usually happened that the local sovereigns prevailed in
      the rivalship for encroachments. Had no external dangers enforced
      internal harmony and subordination, and particularly, had the
      local sovereigns possessed the affections of the people, the great
      kingdoms in Europe would at this time consist of as many
      independent princes as there were formerly feudatory barons. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">The State government will have the advantage of the
      Federal government, whether we compare them in respect to the
      immediate dependence of the one on the other; to the weight of
      personal influence which each side will possess; to the powers
      respectively vested in them; to the predilection and probable
      support of the people; to the disposition and faculty of resisting
      and frustrating the measures of each other. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p7">The State governments may be regarded as constituent
      and essential parts of the federal government; whilst the latter
      is nowise essential to the operation or organization of the
      former. Without the intervention of the State legislatures, the
      President of the United States cannot be elected at all. They must
      in all cases have a great share in his appointment, and will,
      perhaps, in most cases, of themselves determine it. The Senate
      will be elected absolutely and exclusively by the State
      legislatures. Even the House of Representatives, though drawn
      immediately from the people, will be chosen very much under the
      influence of that class of men, whose influence over the people
      obtains for themselves an election into the State legislatures.
      Thus, each of the principal branches of the federal government
      will owe its existence more or less to the favor of the State
      governments, and must consequently feel a dependence, which is
      much more likely to beget a disposition too obsequious than too
      overbearing towards them. On the other side, the component parts
      of the State governments will in no instance be indebted for their
      appointment to the direct agency of the federal government, and
      very little, if at all, to the local influence of its members. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p8">The number of individuals employed under the
      Constitution of the United States will be much smaller than the
      number employed under the particular States. There will
      consequently be less of personal influence on the side of the
      former than of the latter. The members of the legislative,
      executive, and judiciary departments of thirteen and more States,
      the justices of peace, officers of militia, ministerial officers
      of justice, with all the county, corporation, and town officers,
      for three millions and more of people, intermixed, and having
      particular acquaintance with every class and circle of people,
      must exceed, beyond all proportion, both in number and influence,
      those of every description who will be employed in the
      administration of the federal system. Compare the members of the
      three great departments of the thirteen States, excluding from the
      judiciary department the justices of peace, with the members of
      the corresponding departments of the single government of the
      Union; compare the militia officers of three millions of people
      with the military and marine officers of any establishment which
      is within the compass of probability, or, I may add, of
      possibility, and in this view alone, we may pronounce the
      advantage of the States to be decisive. If the federal government
      is to have collectors of revenue, the State governments will have
      theirs also. And as those of the former will be principally on the
      seacoast, and not very numerous, whilst those of the latter will
      be spread over the face of the country, and will be very numerous,
      the advantage in this view also lies on the same side. It is true,
      that the Confederacy is to possess, and may exercise, the power of
      collecting internal as well as external taxes throughout the
      States; but it is probable that this power will not be resorted
      to, except for supplemental purposes of revenue; that an option
      will then be given to the States to supply their quotas by
      previous collections of their own; and that the eventual
      collection, under the immediate authority of the Union, will
      generally be made by the officers, and according to the rules,
      appointed by the several States. Indeed it is extremely probable,
      that in other instances, particularly in the organization of the
      judicial power, the officers of the States will be clothed with
      the correspondent authority of the Union. Should it happen,
      however, that separate collectors of internal revenue should be
      appointed under the federal government, the influence of the whole
      number would not bear a comparison with that of the multitude of
      State officers in the opposite scale. Within every district to
      which a federal collector would be allotted, there would not be
      less than thirty or forty, or even more, officers of different
      descriptions, and many of them persons of character and weight,
      whose influence would lie on the side of the State. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p8">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p9">The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to
      the federal government are few and defined. Those which are to
      remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite. The
      former will be exercised principally on external objects, as war,
      peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce; with which last the
      power of taxation will, for the most part, be connected. The
      powers reserved to the several States will extend to all the
      objects which, in the ordinary course of affairs, concern the
      lives, liberties, and properties of the people, and the internal
      order, improvement, and prosperity of the State. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p9">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p10">The operations of the federal government will be most
      extensive and important in times of war and danger; those of the
      State governments, in times of peace and security. As the former
      periods will probably bear a small proportion to the latter, the
      State governments will here enjoy another advantage over the
      federal government. The more adequate, indeed, the federal powers
      may be rendered to the national defense, the less frequent will be
      those scenes of danger which might favor their ascendancy over the
      governments of the particular States. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p10">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p11">If the new Constitution be examined with accuracy and
      candor, it will be found that the change which it proposes
      consists much less in the addition of <em>new powers</em> to the
      Union, than in the invigoration of its <em>original powers</em>.
      The regulation of commerce, it is true, is a new power; but that
      seems to be an addition which few oppose, and from which no
      apprehensions are entertained. The powers relating to war and
      peace, armies and fleets, treaties and finance, with the other
      more considerable powers, are all <a href="articles#a9">vested in
      the existing Congress by the articles of Confederation</a>. The
      proposed change does not enlarge these powers; it only substitutes
      a more effectual mode of administering them. The change relating
      to taxation may be regarded as the most important; and yet the
      present Congress have as complete authority to <em>require</em> of
      the States indefinite supplies of money for the common defense and
      general welfare, as the future Congress will have to require them
      of individual citizens; and the latter will be no more bound than
      the States themselves have been, to pay the quotas respectively
      taxed on them. Had the States complied punctually with the
      articles of Confederation, or could their compliance have been
      enforced by as peaceable means as may be used with success towards
      single persons, our past experience is very far from countenancing
      an opinion, that the State governments would have lost their
      constitutional powers, and have gradually undergone an entire
      consolidation. To maintain that such an event would have ensued,
      would be to say at once, that the existence of the State
      governments is incompatible with any system whatever that
      accomplishes the essental purposes of the Union. <a
