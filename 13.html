      Advantage of the Union in Respect to Economy in Government
    </h2>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1">As <span class="initial">connected</span> with the
      subject of revenue, we may with propriety consider that of
      economy. The money saved from one object may be usefully applied
      to another, and there will be so much the less to be drawn from
      the pockets of the people. If the States are united under one
      government, there will be but one national civil list to support;
      if they are divided into several confederacies, there will be as
      many different national civil lists to be provided for&#8212;and
      each of them, as to the principal departments, coextensive with
      that which would be necessary for a government of the whole. The
      entire separation of the States into thirteen unconnected
      sovereignties is a project too extravagant and too replete with
      danger to have many advocates. The ideas of men who speculate upon
      the dismemberment of the empire seem generally turned toward three
      confederacies&#8212;one consisting of the four Northern, another
      of the four Middle, and a third of the five Southern States. There
      is little probability that there would be a greater number.
      According to this distribution, each confederacy would comprise an
      extent of territory larger than that of the kingdom of Great
      Britain. No well-informed man will suppose that the affairs of
      such a confederacy can be properly regulated by a government less
      comprehensive in its organs or institutions than that which has
      been proposed by the convention. When the dimensions of a State
      attain to a certain magnitude, it requires the same energy of
      government and the same forms of administration which are
      requisite in one of much greater extent. This idea admits not of
      precise demonstration, because there is no rule by which we can
      measure the momentum of civil power necessary to the government of
      any given number of individuals; but when we consider that the
      island of Britain, nearly commensurate with each of the supposed
      confederacies, contains about eight millions of people, and when
      we reflect upon the degree of authority required to direct the
      passions of so large a society to the public good, we shall see no
      reason to doubt that the like portion of power would be sufficient
      to perform the same task in a society far more numerous. Civil
      power, properly organized and exerted, is capable of diffusing its
      force to a very great extent; and can, in a manner, reproduce
      itself in every part of a great empire by a judicious arrangement
      of subordinate institutions. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">The supposition that each confederacy into which the
      States would be likely to be divided would require a government
      not less comprehensive than the one proposed, will be strengthened
      by another supposition, more probable than that which presents us
      with three confederacies as the alternative to a general Union. If
      we attend carefully to geographical and commercial considerations,
      in conjunction with the habits and prejudices of the different
      States, we shall be led to conclude that in case of disunion they
      will most naturally league themselves under two governments. The
      four Eastern States, from all the causes that form the links of
      national sympathy and connection, may with certainty be expected
      to unite. New York, situated as she is, would never be unwise
      enough to oppose a feeble and unsupported flank to the weight of
      that confederacy. There are other obvious reasons that would
      facilitate her accession to it. New Jersey is too small a State to
      think of being a frontier, in opposition to this still more
      powerful combination; nor do there appear to be any obstacles to
      her admission into it. Even Pennsylvania would have strong
      inducements to join the Northern league. An active foreign
      commerce, on the basis of her own navigation, is her true policy,
      and coincides with the opinions and dispositions of her citizens.
      The more Southern States, from various circumstances, may not
      think themselves much interested in the encouragement of
      navigation. They may prefer a system which would give unlimited
      scope to all nations to be the carriers as well as the purchasers
      of their commodities. Pennsylvania may not choose to confound her
      interests in a connection so adverse to her policy. As she must at
      all events be a frontier, she may deem it most consistent with her
      safety to have her exposed side turned towards the weaker power of
      the Southern, rather than towards the stronger power of the
      Northern, Confederacy. This would give her the fairest chance to
      avoid being the Flanders of America. Whatever may be the
      determination of Pennsylvania, if the Northern Confederacy
      includes New Jersey, there is no likelihood of more than one
      confederacy to the south of that State. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">Nothing can be more evident than that the thirteen
      States will be able to support a national government better than
      one half, or one third, or any number less than the whole. This
      reflection must have great weight in obviating that objection to
      the proposed plan, which is founded on the principle of expense;
      an objection, however, which, when we come to take a nearer view
      of it, will appear in every light to stand on mistaken ground. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">If, in addition to the consideration of a plurality of
      civil lists, we take into view the number of persons who must
      necessarily be employed to guard the inland communication between
      the different confederacies against illicit trade, and who in time
      will infallibly spring up out of the necessities of revenue; and
      if we also take into view the military establishments which it has
      been shown would unavoidably result from the jealousies and
      conflicts of the several nations into which the States would be
      divided, we shall clearly discover that a separation would be not
      less injurious to the economy, than to the tranquillity, commerce,
      revenue, and liberty of every part. <a class="permalink"
