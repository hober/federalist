      The Treaty-Making Power of the Executive
    </h2>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><span class="initial">The</span> President is to have
      power, <q cite="constitution#a2s2c2">by and with the advice and
      consent of the Senate, <a href="constitution#a2s2c2">to make
      treaties</a>, provided two thirds of the senators present
      concur.</q> <a class="permalink" href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">Though this provision has been assailed, on different
      grounds, with no small degree of vehemence, I scruple not to
      declare my firm persuasion, that it is one of the best digested
      and most unexceptionable parts of the plan. One ground of
      objection is the trite topic of the intermixture of powers; some
      contending that the President ought alone to possess the power of
      making treaties; others, that it ought to have been exclusively
      deposited in the Senate. Another source of objection is derived
      from the small number of persons by whom a treaty may be made. Of
      those who espouse this objection, a part are of opinion that the
      House of Representatives ought to have been associated in the
      business, while another part seem to think that nothing more was
      necessary than to have substituted two thirds of <em>all</em> the
      members of the Senate, to two thirds of the members
      <em>present</em>. As I flatter myself the observations made in a
      preceding number upon this part of the plan must have sufficed to
      place it, to a discerning eye, in a very favorable light, I shall
      here content myself with offering only some supplementary remarks,
      principally with a view to the objections which have been just
      stated. <a class="permalink" href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">With regard to the intermixture of powers, I shall rely
      upon the explanations already given in other places, of the true
      sense of the rule upon which that objection is founded; and shall
      take it for granted, as an inference from them, that the union of
      the Executive with the Senate, in the article of treaties, is no
      infringement of that rule. I venture to add, that the particular
      nature of the power of making treaties indicates a peculiar
      propriety in that union. Though several writers on the subject of
      government place that power in the class of executive authorities,
      yet this is evidently an arbitrary disposition; for if we attend
      carefully to its operation, it will be found to partake more of
      the legislative than of the executive character, though it does
      not seem strictly to fall within the definition of either of them.
      The essence of the legislative authority is to enact laws, or, in
      other words, to prescribe rules for the regulation of the society;
      while the execution of the laws, and the employment of the common
      strength, either for this purpose or for the common defense, seem
      to comprise all the functions of the executive magistrate. The
      power of making treaties is, plainly, neither the one nor the
      other. It relates neither to the execution of the subsisting laws,
      nor to the enaction of new ones; and still less to an exertion of
      the common strength. Its objects are <em>contracts</em> with
      foreign nations, which have the force of law, but derive it from
      the obligations of good faith. They are not rules prescribed by
      the sovereign to the subject, but agreements between sovereign and
      sovereign. The power in question seems therefore to form a
      distinct department, and to belong, properly, neither to the
      legislative nor to the executive. The qualities elsewhere detailed
      as indispensable in the management of foreign negotiations, point
      out the Executive as the most fit agent in those transactions;
      while the vast importance of the trust, and the operation of
      treaties as laws, plead strongly for the participation of the
      whole or a portion of the legislative body in the office of making
      them. <a class="permalink" href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">However proper or safe it may be in governments where
      the executive magistrate is an hereditary monarch, to commit to
      him the entire power of making treaties, it would be utterly
      unsafe and improper to intrust that power to an elective
      magistrate of four years' duration. It has been remarked, upon
      another occasion, and the remark is unquestionably just, that an
      hereditary monarch, though often the oppressor of his people, has
      personally too much stake in the government to be in any material
      danger of being corrupted by foreign powers. But a man raised from
      the station of a private citizen to the rank of chief magistrate,
      possessed of a moderate or slender fortune, and looking forward to
      a period not very remote when he may probably be obliged to return
      to the station from which he was taken, might sometimes be under
      temptations to sacrifice his duty to his interest, which it would
      require superlative virtue to withstand. An avaricious man might
      be tempted to betray the interests of the state to the acquisition
      of wealth. An ambitious man might make his own aggrandizement, by
      the aid of a foreign power, the price of his treachery to his
      constituents. The history of human conduct does not warrant that
      exalted opinion of human virtue which would make it wise in a
      nation to commit interests of so delicate and momentous a kind, as
      those which concern its intercourse with the rest of the world, to
      the sole disposal of a magistrate created and circumstanced as
      would be a President of the United States. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">To have intrusted the power of making treaties to the
      Senate alone, would have been to relinquish the benefits of the
      constitutional agency of the President in the conduct of foreign
      negotiations. It is true that the Senate would, in that case, have
      the option of employing him in this capacity, but they would also
      have the option of letting it alone, and pique or cabal might
      induce the latter rather than the former. Besides this, the
      ministerial servant of the Senate could not be expected to enjoy
      the confidence and respect of foreign powers in the same degree
      with the constitutional representatives of the nation, and, of
      course, would not be able to act with an equal degree of weight or
      efficacy. While the Union would, from this cause, lose a
      considerable advantage in the management of its external concerns,
      the people would lose the additional security which would result
      from the co-operation of the Executive. Though it would be
      imprudent to confide in him solely so important a trust, yet it
      cannot be doubted that his participation would materially add to
      the safety of the society. It must indeed be clear to a
      demonstration that the joint possession of the power in question,
      by the President and Senate, would afford a greater prospect of
      security, than the separate possession of it by either of them.
      And whoever has maturely weighed the circumstances which must
      concur in the appointment of a President, will be satisfied that
      the office will always bid fair to be filled by men of such
      characters as to render their concurrence in the formation of
      treaties peculiarly desirable, as well on the score of wisdom, as
      on that of integrity. <a class="permalink" href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">The remarks made in a former number, which have been
      alluded to in another part of this paper, will apply with
      conclusive force against the admission of the House of
      Representatives to a share in the formation of treaties. The
      fluctuating and, taking its future increase into the account, the
      multitudinous composition of that body, forbid us to expect in it
      those qualities which are essential to the proper execution of
      such a trust. Accurate and comprehensive knowledge of foreign
      politics; a steady and systematic adherence to the same views; a
      nice and uniform sensibility to national character; decision,
      <em>secrecy</em>, and despatch, are incompatible with the genius
      of a body so variable and so numerous. The very complication of
      the business, by introducing a necessity of the concurrence of so
      many different bodies, would of itself afford a solid objection.
      The greater frequency of the calls upon the House of
      Representatives, and the greater length of time which it would
      often be necessary to keep them together when convened, to obtain
      their sanction in the progressive stages of a treaty, would be a
      source of so great inconvenience and expense as alone ought to
      condemn the project. <a class="permalink" href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p7">The only objection which remains to be canvassed, is
      that which would substitute the proportion of two thirds of all
      the members composing the senatorial body, to that of two thirds
      of the members <em>present</em>. It has been shown, under the
      second head of our inquiries, that all provisions which require
      more than the majority of any body to its resolutions, have a
      direct tendency to embarrass the operations of the government, and
      an indirect one to subject the sense of the majority to that of
      the minority. This consideration seems sufficient to determine our
      opinion, that the convention have gone as far in the endeavor to
      secure the advantage of numbers in the formation of treaties as
      could have been reconciled either with the activity of the public
      councils or with a reasonable regard to the major sense of the
      community. If two thirds of the whole number of members had been
      required, it would, in many cases, from the non-attendance of a
      part, amount in practice to a necessity of unanimity. And the
      history of every political establishment in which this principle
      has prevailed, is a history of impotence, perplexity, and
      disorder. Proofs of this position might be adduced from the
      examples of the Roman Tribuneship, the Polish Diet, and the
      States-General of the Netherlands, did not an example at home
      render foreign precedents unnecessary. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p8">To require a fixed proportion of the whole body would
      not, in all probability, contribute to the advantages of a
      numerous agency, better then merely to require a proportion of the
      attending members. The former, by making a determinate number at
      all times requisite to a resolution, diminishes the motives to
      punctual attendance. The latter, by making the capacity of the
      body to depend on a <em>proportion</em> which may be varied by the
      absence or presence of a single member, has the contrary effect.
      And as, by promoting punctuality, it tends to keep the body
      complete, there is great likelihood that its resolutions would
      generally be dictated by as great a number in this case as in the
      other; while there would be much fewer occasions of delay. It
      ought not to be forgotten that, under the existing Confederation,
      two members <em>may</em>, and usually <em>do</em>, represent a
      State; whence it happens that Congress, who now are solely
      invested with <em>all the powers</em> of the Union, rarely consist
      of a greater number of persons than would compose the intended
      Senate. If we add to this, that as the members vote by States, and
      that where there is only a single member present from a State, his
      vote is lost, it will justify a supposition that the active voices
      in the Senate, where the members are to vote individually, would
      rarely fall short in number of the active voices in the existing
      Congress. When, in addition to these considerations, we take into
      view the co-operation of the President, we shall not hesitate to
      infer that the people of America would have greater security
      against an improper use of the power of making treaties, under the
      new Constitution, than they now enjoy under the Confederation. And
      when we proceed still one step further, and look forward to the
      probable augmentation of the Senate, by the erection of new
      States, we shall not only perceive ample ground of confidence in
      the sufficiency of the members to whose agency that power will be
      intrusted, but we shall probably be led to conclude that a body
      more numerous than the Senate would be likely to become, would be
      very little fit for the proper discharge of the trust. <a
