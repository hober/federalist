    <h2 class="entry-summary">The Mode of Electing the President</h2>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><a href="constitution.html#a2s1c3"><span
      class="initial">The</span> mode of appointment of the Chief
      Magistrate of the United States</a> is almost the only part of the
      system, of any consequence, which has escaped without severe
      censure, or which has received the slightest mark of approbation
      from its opponents. The most plausible of these, who has appeared
      in print, has even deigned to admit that the election of the
      President is pretty well guarded.<a class="note"
      href="#note1">1</a> I venture somewhat further, and hesitate not
      to affirm, that if the manner of it be not perfect, it is at least
      excellent. It unites in an eminent degree all the advantages, the
      union of which was to be wished for. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">It was desirable that the sense of the people should
      operate in the choice of the person to whom so important a trust
      was to be confided. This end will be answered by committing the
      right of making it, not to any preestablished body, but to men
      chosen by the people for the special purpose, and at the
      particular conjuncture. <a class="permalink" href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">It was equally desirable, that the immediate election
      should be made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities
      adapted to the station, and acting under circumstances favorable
      to deliberation, and to a judicious combination of all the reasons
      and inducements which were proper to govern their choice. A small
      number of persons, selected by their fellow-citizens from the
      general mass, will be most likely to possess the information and
      discernment requisite to such complicated investigations. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">It was also peculiarly desirable to afford as little
      opportunity as possible to tumult and disorder. This evil was not
      least to be dreaded in the election of a magistrate, who was to
      have so important an agency in the administration of the
      government as the President of the United States. But the
      precautions which have been so happily concerted in the system
      under consideration, promise an effectual security against this
      mischief. The choice of <em>several</em>, to form an intermediate
      body of electors, will be much less apt to convulse the community
      with any extraordinary or violent movements, than the choice of
      <em>one</em> who was himself to be the final object of the public
      wishes. And as the electors, chosen in each State, are to assemble
      and vote in the State in which they are chosen, this detached and
      divided situation will expose them much less to heats and
      ferments, which might be communicated from them to the people,
      than if they were all to be convened at one time, in one place. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">Nothing was more to be desired than that every
      practicable obstacle should be opposed to cabal, intrigue, and
      corruption. These most deadly adversaries of republican government
      might naturally have been expected to make their approaches from
      more than one querter, but chiefly from the desire in foreign
      powers to gain an improper ascendant in our councils. How could
      they better gratify this, than by raising a creature of their own
      to the chief magistracy of the Union? But the convention have
      guarded against all danger of this sort, with the most provident
      and judicious attention. They have not made the appointment of the
      President to depend on any preexisting bodies of men, who might be
      tampered with beforehand to prostitute their votes; but they have
      referred it in the first instance to an immediate act of the
      people of America, to be exerted in the choice of persons for the
      temporary and sole purpose of making the appointment. And they
      have excluded from eligibility to this trust, all those who from
      situation might be suspected of too great devotion to the
      President in office. No senator, representative, or other person
      holding a place of trust or profit under the United States, can be
      of the numbers of the electors. Thus without corrupting the body
      of the people, the immediate agents in the election will at least
      enter upon the task free from any sinister bias. Their transient
      existence, and their detached situation, already taken notice of,
      afford a satisfactory prospect of their continuing so, to the
      conclusion of it. The business of corruption, when it is to
      embrace so considerable a number of men, requires time as well as
      means. Nor would it be found easy suddenly to embark them,
      dispersed as they would be over thirteen States, in any
      combinations founded upon motives, which though they could not
      properly be denominated corrupt, might yet be of a nature to
      mislead them from their duty. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">Another and no less important desideratum was, that the
      Executive should be independent for his continuance in office on
      all but the people themselves. He might otherwise be tempted to
      sacrifice his duty to his complaisance for those whose favor was
      necessary to the duration of his official consequence. This
      advantage will also be secured, by making his re-election to
      depend on a special body of representatives, deputed by the
      society for the single purpose of making the important choice. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p7">All these advantages will happily combine in the plan
      devised by the convention; which is, that the people of each State
      shall choose a number of persons as electors, equal to the number
      of senators and representatives of such State in the national
      government, who shall assemble within the State, and vote for some
      fit person as President. Their votes, thus given, are to be
      transmitted to the seat of the national government, and the person
      who may happen to have a majority of the whole number of votes
      will be the President. But as a majority of the votes might not
      always happen to centre in one man, and as it might be unsafe to
      permit less than a majority to be conclusive, it is provided that,
      in such a contingency, the House of Representatives shall select
      out of the candidates who shall have the five highest number of
      votes, the man who in their opinion may be best qualified for the
      office. <a class="permalink" href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p8">The process of election affords a moral certainty, that
      the office of President will never fall to the lot of any man who
      is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite
      qualifications. Talents for low intrigue, and the little arts of
      popularity, may alone suffice to elevate a man to the first honors
      in a single State; but it will require other talents, and a
      different kind of merit, to establish him in the esteem and
      confidence of the whole Union, or of so considerable a portion of
      it as would be necessary to make him a successful candidate for
      the distinguished office of President of the United States. It
      will not be too strong to say, that there will be a constant
      probability of seeing the station filled by characters pre-eminent
      for ability and virtue. And this will be thought no inconsiderable
      recommendation of the Constitution, by those who are able to
      estimate the share which the executive in every government must
      necessarily have in its good or ill administration. Though we
      cannot acquiesce in the political heresy of the poet who says: <q
      title="from Epistle III of Alexander Pope's 'An Essay on Man'">For
      forms of government let fools contest That which is best
      administered is best,</q> yet we may safely pronounce, that the
      true test of a good government is its aptitude and tendency to
      produce a good administration. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p8">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p9">The Vice-President is to be chosen in the same manner
      with the President; with this difference, that the Senate is to
      do, in respect to the former, what is to be done by the House of
      Representatives, in respect to the latter. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p9">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p10">The appointment of an extraordinary person, as
      Vice-President, has been objected to as superfluous, if not
      mischievous. It has been alleged, that it would have been
      preferable to have authorized the Senate to elect out of their own
      body an officer answering that description. But two considerations
      seem to justify the ideas of the convention in this respect. One
      is, that to secure at all times the possibility of a definite
      resolution of the body, it is necessary that the President should
      have only a casting vote. And to take the senator of any State
      from his seat as senator, to place him in that of President of the
      Senate, would be to exchange, in regard to the State from which he
      came, a constant for a contingent vote. The other consideration
      is, that as the Vice-President may occasionally become a
      substitute for the President, in the supreme executive magistracy,
      all the reasons which recommend the mode of election prescribed
      for the one, apply with great if not with equal force to the
      manner of appointing the other. It is remarkable that in this, as
      in most other instances, the objection which is made would lie
      against the constitution of this State. We have a
      Lieutenant-Governor, chosen by the people at large, who presides
      in the Senate, and is the constitutional substitute for the
      Governor, in casualties similar to those which would authorize the
      Vice-President to exercise the authorities and discharge the
      duties of the President. <a class="permalink"
