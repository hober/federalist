      Concerning Dangers from Dissensions Between the States
    </h2>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><span class="initial">The</span> <a
      href="3">three</a> <a href="4">last</a> <a
      href="5">numbers</a> of this paper have been dedicated to an
      enumeration of the dangers to which we should be exposed, in a
      state of disunion, from the arms and arts of foreign nations. I
      shall now proceed to delineate dangers of a different and,
      perhaps, still more alarming kind&#8212;those which will in all
      probability flow from dissensions between the States themselves,
      and from domestic factions and convulsions. These have been
      already in some instances slightly anticipated; but they deserve a
      more particular and more full investigation. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">A man must be far gone in Utopian speculations who can
      seriously doubt that, if these States should either be wholly
      disunited, or only united in partial confederacies, the
      subdivisions into which they might be thrown would have frequent
      and violent contests with each other. To presume a want of motives
      for such contests as an argument against their existence, would be
      to forget that men are ambitious, vindictive, and rapacious. To
      look for a continuation of harmony between a number of
      independent, unconnected sovereignties in the same neighborhood,
      would be to disregard the uniform course of human events, and to
      set at defiance the accumulated experience of ages. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">The causes of hostility among nations are innumerable.
      There are some which have a general and almost constant operation
      upon the collective bodies of society. Of this description are the
      love of power or the desire of pre-eminence and dominion&#8212;the
      jealousy of power, or the desire of equality and safety. There are
      others which have a more circumscribed though an equally operative
      influence within their spheres. Such are the rivalships and
      competitions of commerce between commercial nations. And there are
      others, not less numerous than either of the former, which take
      their origin entirely in private passions; in the attachments,
      enmities, interests, hopes, and fears of leading individuals in
      the communities of which they are members. Men of this class,
      whether the favorites of a king or of a people, have in too many
      instances abused the confidence they possessed; and assuming the
      pretext of some public motive, have not scrupled to sacrifice the
      national tranquillity to personal advantage or personal
      gratification. <a class="permalink" href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">The celebrated Pericles, in compliance with the
      resentment of a prostitute,<a class="note" href="#note1">1</a> at
      the expense of much of the blood and treasure of his countrymen,
      attacked, vanquished, and destroyed the city of the
      <em>Samnians</em>. The same man, stimulated by private pique
      against the <em>Megarensians</em>,<a class="note"
      href="#note2">2</a> another nation of Greece, or to avoid a
      prosecution with which he was threatened as an accomplice of a
      supposed theft of the statuary Phidias,<a class="note"
      href="#note3">3</a> or to get rid of the accusations prepared to
      be brought against him for dissipating the funds of the state in
      the purchase of popularity,<a class="note" href="#note4">4</a> or
      from a combination of all these causes, was the primitive author
      of that famous and fatal war, distinguished in the Grecian annals
      by the name of the <em>Peloponnesian</em> war; which, after
      various vicissitudes, intermissions, and renewals, terminated in
      the ruin of the Athenian commonwealth. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">The ambitious cardinal, who was prime minister to Henry
      VIII., permitting his vanity to aspire to the triple crown,<a
      class="note" href="#note5">5</a> entertained hopes of succeeding
      in the acquisition of that splendid prize by the influence of the
      Emperor Charles V. To secure the favor and interest of this
      enterprising and powerful monarch, he precipitated England into a
      war with France, contrary to the plainest dictates of policy, and
      at the hazard of the safety and independence, as well of the
      kingdom over which he presided by his counsels, as of Europe in
      general. For if there ever was a sovereign who bid fair to realize
      the project of universal monarchy, it was the Emperor Charles V.,
      of whose intrigues Wolsey was at once the instrument and the dupe.
      <a class="permalink" href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">The influence which the bigotry of one female,<a
      class="note" href="#note6">6</a> the petulance of another,<a
      class="note" href="#note7">7</a> and the cabals of a third,<a
      class="note" href="#note8">8</a> had in the contemporary policy,
      ferments, and pacifications, of a considerable part of Europe, are
      topics that have been too often descanted upon not to be generally
      known. <a class="permalink" href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p7">To multiply examples of the agency of personal
      considerations in the production of great national events, either
      foreign or domestic, according to their direction, would be an
      unnecessary waste of time. Those who have but a superficial
      acquaintance with the sources from which they are to be drawn,
      will themselves recollect a variety of instances; and those who
      have a tolerable knowledge of human nature will not stand in need
      of such lights to form their opinion either of the reality or
      extent of that agency. Perhaps, however, a reference, tending to
      illustrate the general principle, may with propriety be made to a
      case which has lately happened among ourselves. If Shays had not
      been a <em>desperate debtor</em>, it is much to be doubted whether
      Massachusetts would have been <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shays'_Rebellion">plunged into
      a civil war</a>. <a class="permalink" href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p8">But notwithstanding the concurring testimony of
      experience, in this particular, there are still to be found
      visionary or designing men, who stand ready to advocate the
      paradox of perpetual peace between the States, though dismembered
      and alienated from each other. The genius of republics (say they)
      is pacific; the spirit of commerce has a tendency to soften the
      manners of men, and to extinguish those inflammable humors which
      have so often kindled into wars. Commercial republics, like ours,
      will never be disposed to waste themselves in ruinous contentions
      with each other. They will be governed by mutual interest, and
      will cultivate a spirit of mutual amity and concord. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p8">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p9">Is it not (we may ask these projectors in politics) the
      true interest of all nations to cultivate the same benevolent and
      philosophic spirit? If this be their true interest, have they in
      fact pursued it? Has it not, on the contrary, invariably been
      found that momentary passions, and immediate interest, have a more
      active and imperious control over human conduct than general or
      remote considerations of policy, utility or justice? Have
      republics in practice been less addicted to war than monarchies?
      Are not the former administered by <em>men</em> as well as the
      latter? Are there not aversions, predilections, rivalships, and
      desires of unjust acquisitions, that affect nations as well as
      kings? Are not popular assemblies frequently subject to the
      impulses of rage, resentment, jealousy, avarice, and of other
      irregular and violent propensities? Is it not well known that
      their determinations are often governed by a few individuals in
      whom they place confidence, and are, of course, liable to be
      tinctured by the passions and views of those individuals? Has
      commerce hitherto done anything more than change the objects of
      war? Is not the love of wealth as domineering and enterprising a
      passion as that of power or glory? Have there not been as many
      wars founded upon commercial motives since that has become the
      prevailing system of nations, as were before occasioned by the
      cupidity of territory or dominion? Has not the spirit of commerce,
      in many instances, administered new incentives to the appetite,
      both for the one and for the other? Let experience, the least
      fallible guide of human opinions, be appealed to for an answer to
      these inquiries. <a class="permalink" href="#p9">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p10">Sparta, Athens, Rome, and Carthage were all republics;
      two of them, Athens and Carthage, of the commercial kind. Yet were
      they as often engaged in wars, offensive and defensive, as the
      neighboring monarchies of the same times. Sparta was little better
      than a well-regulated camp; and Rome was never sated of carnage
      and conquest. <a class="permalink" href="#p10">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p11">Carthage, though a commercial republic, was the
      aggressor in the very war that ended in her destruction. Hannibal
      had carried her arms into the heart of Italy and to the gates of
      Rome, before Scipio, in turn, gave him an overthrow in the
      territories of Carthage, and made a conquest of the commonwealth.
      <a class="permalink" href="#p11">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p12">Venice, in later times, figured more than once in wars
      of ambition, till, becoming an object to the other Italian states,
      Pope Julius II. found means to accomplish that formidable
      league,<a class="note" href="#note9">9</a> which gave a deadly
      blow to the power and pride of this haughty republic. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p12">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p13">The provinces of Holland, till they were overwhelmed
      in debts and taxes, took a leading and conspicuous part in the
      wars of Europe. They had furious contests with England for the
      dominion of the sea, and were among the most persevering and most
      implacable of the opponents of Louis XIV. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p13">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p14">In the government of Britain the representatives of
      the people compose one branch of the national legislature.
      Commerce has been for ages the predominant pursuit of that
      country. Few nations, nevertheless, have been more frequently
      engaged in war; and the wars in which that kingdom has been
      engaged have, in numerous instances, proceeded from the people. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p14">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p15">There have been, if I may so express it, almost as
      many popular as royal wars. The cries of the nation and the
      importunities of their representatives have, upon various
      occasions, dragged their monarchs into war, or continued them in
      it, contrary to their inclinations, and sometimes contrary to the
      real interests of the State. In that memorable struggle for
      superiority between the rival houses of <em>Austria</em> and
      <em>Bourbon</em>, which so long kept Europe in a flame, it is well
      known that the antipathies of the English against the French,
      seconding the ambition, or rather the avarice, of a favorite
      leader,<a class="note" href="#note10">10</a> protracted the war
      beyond the limits marked out by sound policy, and for a
      considerable time in opposition to the views of the court. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p15">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p16">The wars of these two last-mentioned nations have in a
      great measure grown out of commercial considerations,&#8212;the
      desire of supplanting and the fear of being supplanted, either in
      particular branches of traffic or in the general advantages of
      trade and navigation. <a class="permalink" href="#p16">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p17">From this summary of what has taken place in other
      countries, whose situations have borne the nearest resemblance to
      our own, what reason can we have to confide in those reveries
      which would seduce us into an expectation of peace and cordiality
      between the members of the present confederacy, in a state of
      separation? Have we not already seen enough of the fallacy and
      extravagance of those idle theories which have amused us with
      promises of an exemption from the imperfections, weaknesses and
      evils incident to society in every shape? Is it not time to awake
      from the deceitful dream of a golden age, and to adopt as a
      practical maxim for the direction of our political conduct that
      we, as well as the other inhabitants of the globe, are yet remote
      from the happy empire of perfect wisdom and perfect virtue? <a
      class="permalink" href="#p17">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p18">Let the point of extreme depression to which our
      national dignity and credit have sunk, let the inconveniences felt
      everywhere from a lax and ill administration of government, let
      the revolt of a part of the State of North Carolina, the late
      menacing disturbances in Pennsylvania, and the actual
      insurrections and rebellions in Massachusetts, declare&#8212;! <a
      class="permalink" href="#p18">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p19">So far is the general sense of mankind from
      corresponding with the tenets of those who endeavor to lull asleep
      our apprehensions of discord and hostility between the States, in
      the event of disunion, that it has from long observation of the
      progress of society become a sort of axiom in politics, that
      vicinity or nearness of situation, constitutes nations natural
      enemies. An intelligent writer expresses himself on this subject
      to this effect: <q><em>Neighboring nations</em> (says he) are
      naturally enemies of each other unless their common weakness
      forces them to league in a <em>confederate republic</em>, and
      their constitution prevents the differences that neighborhood
      occasions, extinguishing that secret jealousy which disposes all
      states to aggrandize themselves at the expense of their
      neighbors.</q><a class="note" href="#note11">11</a> This passage,
      at the same time, points out the <em>evil</em> and suggests the
      <em>remedy</em>. <a class="permalink" href="#p19">&#182;</a></p>
