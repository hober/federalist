      The Powers Necessary to the Common Defense Further Considered
    </h2>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1">To <span class="initial">the</span> powers proposed to
      be conferred upon the federal government, in respect to the
      creation and direction of the national forces, I have met with but
      one specific objection, which, if I understand it right, is this,
      that proper provision has not been made against the existence of
      standing armies in time of peace; an objection which, I shall now
      endeavor to show, rests on weak and unsubstantial foundations. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">It has indeed been brought forward in the most vague
      and general form, supported only by bold assertions, without the
      appearance of argument; without even the sanction of theoretical
      opinions; in contradiction to the practice of other free nations,
      and to the general sense of America, as expressed in most of the
      existing constitutions. The proprietory of this remark will
      appear, the moment it is recollected that the objection under
      consideration turns upon a supposed necessity of restraining the
      <em>legislative</em> authority of the nation, in the article of
      military establishments; a principle unheard of, except in one or
      two of our State constitutions, and rejected in all the rest. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">A stranger to our politics, who was to read our
      newspapers at the present juncture, without having previously
      inspected the plan reported by the convention, would be naturally
      led to one of two conclusions: either that it contained a positive
      injunction, that standing armies should be kept up in time of
      peace; or that it vested in the <em>executive</em> the whole power
      of levying troops, without subjecting his discretion, in any
      shape, to the control of the legislature. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">If he came afterwards to peruse the plan itself, he
      would be surprised to discover, that neither the one nor the other
      was the case; that the whole power of raising armies was lodged in
      the <em>legislature</em>, not in the <em>executive</em>; that this
      legislature was to be a popular body, consisting of the
      representatives of the people periodically elected; and that
      instead of the provision he had supposed in favor of standing
      armies, there was to be found, in respect to this object, an
      important qualification even of the legislative discretion, in <a
      href="constitution#a1s8c12">that clause</a> which forbids the
      appropriation of money for the support of an army for any longer
      period than two years a precaution which, upon a nearer view of
      it, will appear to be a great and real security against the
      keeping up of troops without evident necessity. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">Disappointed in his first surmise, the person I have
      supposed would be apt to pursue his conjectures a little further.
      He would naturally say to himself, it is impossible that all this
      vehement and pathetic declamation can be without some colorable
      pretext. It must needs be that this people, so jealous of their
      liberties, have, in all the preceding models of the constitutions
      which they have established, inserted the most precise and rigid
      precautions on this point, the omission of which, in the new plan,
      has given birth to all this apprehension and clamor. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">If, under this impression, he proceeded to pass in
      review the several State constitutions, how great would be his
      disappointment to find that <em>two only</em> of them<a
      class="note" href="#note1">1</a> contained an interdiction of
      standing armies in time of peace; that the other eleven had either
      observed a profound silence on the subject, or had in express
      terms admitted the right of the Legislature to authorize their
      existence. <a class="permalink" href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p7">Still, however he would be persuaded that there must be
      some plausible foundation for the cry raised on this head. He
      would never be able to imagine, while any source of information
      remained unexplored, that it was nothing more than an experiment
      upon the public credulity, dictated either by a deliberate
      intention to deceive, or by the overflowings of a zeal too
      intemperate to be ingenuous. It would probably occur to him, that
      he would be likely to find the precautions he was in search of in
      the primitive compact between the States. Here, at length, he
      would expect to meet with a solution of the enigma. No doubt, he
      would observe to himself, the existing Confederation must contain
      the most explicit provisions against military establishments in
      time of peace; and a departure from this model, in a favorite
      point, has occasioned the discontent which appears to influence
      these political champions. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p8">If he should now apply himself to a careful and
      critical survey of the articles of Confederation, his astonishment
      would not only be increased, but would acquire a mixture of
      indignation, at the unexpected discovery, that these articles,
      instead of containing the prohibition he looked for, and though
      they had, with jealous circumspection, restricted the authority of
      the State legislatures in this particular, had not imposed a
      single restraint on that of the United States. If he happened to
      be a man of quick sensibility, or ardent temper, he could now no
      longer refrain from regarding these clamors as the dishonest
      artifices of a sinister and unprincipled opposition to a plan
      which ought at least to receive a fair and candid examination from
      all sincere lovers of their country! How else, he would say, could
      the authors of them have been tempted to vent such loud censures
      upon that plan, about a point in which it seems to have conformed
      itself to the general sense of America as declared in its
      different forms of government, and in which it has even superadded
      a new and powerful guard unknown to any of them? If, on the
      contrary, he happened to be a man of calm and dispassionate
      feelings, he would indulge a sigh for the frailty of human nature,
      and would lament, that in a matter so interesting to the happiness
      of millions, the true merits of the question should be perplexed
      and entangled by expedients so unfriendly to an impartial and
      right determination. Even such a man could hardly forbear
      remarking, that a conduct of this kind has too much the appearance
      of an intention to mislead the people by alarming their passions,
      rather than to convince them by arguments addressed to their
      understandings. <a class="permalink" href="#p8">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p9">But however little this objection may be countenanced,
      even by precedents among ourselves, it may be satisfactory to take
      a nearer view of its intrinsic merits. From a close examination it
      will appear that restraints upon the discretion of the legislature
      in respect to military establishments in time of peace, would be
      improper to be imposed, and if imposed, from the necessities of
      society, would be unlikely to be observed. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p9">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p10">Though a wide ocean separates the United States from
      Europe, yet there are various considerations that warn us against
      an excess of confidence or security. On one side of us, and
      stretching far into our rear, are growing settlements subject to
      the dominion of Britain. On the other side, and extending to meet
      the British settlements, are colonies and establishments subject
      to the dominion of Spain. This situation and the vicinity of the
      West India Islands, belonging to these two powers create between
      them, in respect to their American possessions and in relation to
      us, a common interest. The savage tribes on our Western frontier
      ought to be regarded as our natural enemies, their natural allies,
      because they have most to fear from us, and most to hope from
      them. The improvements in the art of navigation have, as to the
      facility of communication, rendered distant nations, in a great
      measure, neighbors. Britain and Spain are among the principal
      maritime powers of Europe. A future concert of views between these
      nations ought not to be regarded as improbable. The increasing
      remoteness of consanguinity is every day diminishing the force of
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Bourbon">the family
      compact between France and Spain</a>. And politicians have ever
      with great reason considered the ties of blood as feeble and
      precarious links of political connection. These circumstances
      combined, admonish us not to be too sanguine in considering
      ourselves as entirely out of the reach of danger. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p10">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p11">Previous to the Revolution, and ever since the peace,
      there has been a constant necessity for keeping small garrisons on
      our Western frontier. No person can doubt that these will continue
      to be indispensable, if it should only be against the ravages and
      depredations of the Indians. These garrisons must either be
      furnished by occasional detachments from the militia, or by
      permanent corps in the pay of the government. The first is
      impracticable; and if practicable, would be pernicious. The
      militia would not long, if at all, submit to be dragged from their
      occupations and families to perform that most disagreeable duty in
      times of profound peace. And if they could be prevailed upon or
      compelled to do it, the increased expense of a frequent rotation
      of service, and the loss of labor and disconcertion of the
      industrious pursuits of individuals, would form conclusive
      objections to the scheme. It would be as burdensome and injurious
      to the public as ruinous to private citizens. The latter resource
      of permanent corps in the pay of the government amounts to a
      standing army in time of peace; a small one, indeed, but not the
      less real for being small. Here is a simple view of the subject,
      that shows us at once the impropriety of a constitutional
      interdiction of such establishments, and the necessity of leaving
      the matter to the discretion and prudence of the legislature. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p11">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p12">In proportion to our increase in strength, it is
      probable, nay, it may be said certain, that Britain and Spain
      would augment their military establishments in our neighborhood.
      If we should not be willing to be exposed, in a naked and
      defenseless condition, to their insults and encroachments, we
      should find it expedient to increase our frontier garrisons in
      some ratio to the force by which our Western settlements might be
      annoyed. There are, and will be, particular posts, the possession
      of which will include the command of large districts of territory,
      and facilitate future invasions of the remainder. It may be added
      that some of those posts will be keys to the trade with the Indian
      nations. Can any man think it would be wise to leave such posts in
      a situation to be at any instant seized by one or the other of two
      neighboring and formidable powers? To act this part would be to
      desert all the usual maxims of prudence and policy. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p12">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p13">If we mean to be a commercial people, or even to be
      secure on our Atlantic side, we must endeavor, as soon as
      possible, to have a navy. To this purpose there must be dock-yards
      and arsenals; and for the defense of these, fortifications, and
      probably garrisons. When a nation has become so powerful by sea
      that it can protect its dock-yards by its fleets, this supersedes
      the necessity of garrisons for that purpose; but where naval
      establishments are in their infancy, moderate garrisons will, in
      all likelihood, be found an indispensable security against
      descents for the destruction of the arsenals and dock-yards, and
      sometimes of the fleet itself. <a class="permalink"

          This statement of the matter is taken from the printed
          collection of State constitutions. Pennsylvania and North
          Carolina are the two which contain the interdiction in these
          words: <q>As standing armies in time of peace are dangerous to
          liberty, <em>they ought not</em> to be kept up.</q> This is,
          in truth, rather a <em>caution</em> than a
          <em>prohibition</em>. New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Delaware,
          and Maryland have, in each of their bils of rights, a clause
          to this effect: <q>Standing armies are dangerous to liberty,
          and ought not to be raised or kept up <em>without the consent
          of the legislature</em></q>; which is a formal admission of
          the authority of the Legislature. New York has no bills of
          rights, and her constitution says not a word about the matter.
          No bills of rights appear annexed to the constitutions of the
          other States, except the foregoing, and their constitutions
          are equally silent. I am told, however that one or two States
          have bills of rights which do not appear in this collection;
          but that those also recognize the right of the legislative
          authority in this respect.
