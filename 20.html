      The Insufficiency fo the Present Confederation to Preserve the
      Union
    </h3>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><span class="initial">The</span> United Netherlands are
      a confederacy of republics, or rather of aristocracies of a very
      remarkable texture, yet confirming all the lessons derived from
      those which we have already reviewed. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">The union is composed of seven coequal and sovereign
      states, and each state or province is a composition of equal and
      independent cities. In all important cases, not only the provinces
      but the cities must be unanimous. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">The sovereignty of the Union is represented by the
      States-General, consisting usually of about fifty deputies
      appointed by the provinces. They hold their seats, some for life,
      some for six, three, and one years; from two provinces they
      continue in appointment during pleasure. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">The States-General have authority to enter into
      treaties and alliances; to make war and peace; to raise armies and
      equip fleets; to ascertain quotas and demand contributions. In all
      these cases, however, unanimity and the sanction of their
      constituents are requisite. They have authority to appoint and
      receive ambassadors; to execute treaties and alliances already
      formed; to provide for the collection of duties on imports and
      exports; to regulate the mint, with a saving to the provincial
      rights; to govern as sovereigns the dependent territories. The
      provinces are restrained, unless with the general consent, from
      entering into foreign treaties; from establishing imposts
      injurious to others, or charging their neighbors with higher
      duties than their own subjects. A council of state, a chamber of
      accounts, with five colleges of admiralty, aid and fortify the
      federal administration. <a class="permalink" href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">The executive magistrate of the union is the
      stadtholder, who is now an hereditary prince. His principal weight
      and influence in the republic are derived from this independent
      title; from his great patrimonial estates; from his family
      connections with some of the chief potentates of Europe; and, more
      than all, perhaps, from his being stadtholder in the several
      provinces, as well as for the union; in which provincial quality
      he has the appointment of town magistrates under certain
      regulations, executes provincial decrees, presides when he pleases
      in the provincial tribunals, and has throughout the power of
      pardon. <a class="permalink" href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">As stadtholder of the union, he has, however,
      considerable prerogatives. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p7">In his political capacity he has authority to settle
      disputes between the provinces, when other methods fail; to assist
      at the deliberations of the States-General, and at their
      particular conferences; to give audiences to foreign ambassadors,
      and to keep agents for his particular affairs at foreign courts.
      <a class="permalink" href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p8">In his military capacity he commands the federal
      troops, provides for garrisons, and in general regulates military
      affairs; disposes of all appointments, from colonels to ensigns,
      and of the governments and posts of fortified towns. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p8">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p9">In his marine capacity he is admiral-general, and
      superintends and directs every thing relative to naval forces and
      other naval affairs; presides in the admiralties in person or by
      proxy; appoints lieutenant-admirals and other officers; and
      establishes councils of war, whose sentences are not executed till
      he approves them. <a class="permalink" href="#p9">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p10">His revenue, exclusive of his private income, amounts
      to three hundred thousand florins. The standing army which he
      commands consists of about forty thousand men. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p10">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p11">Such is the nature of the celebrated Belgic
      confederacy, as delineated on parchment. What are the characters
      which practice has stamped upon it? Imbecility in the government;
      discord among the provinces; foreign influence and indignities; a
      precarious existence in peace, and peculiar calamities from war.
      <a class="permalink" href="#p11">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p12">It was long ago remarked by Grotius, that nothing but
      the hatred of his countrymen to the house of Austria kept them
      from being ruined by the vices of their constitution. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p12">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p13">The union of Utrecht, says another respectable writer,
      reposes an authority in the States-General, seemingly sufficient
      to secure harmony, but the jealousy in each province renders the
      practice very different from the theory. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p13">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p14">The same instrument, says another, obliges each
      province to levy certain contributions; but this article never
      could, and probably never will, be executed; because the inland
      provinces, who have little commerce, cannot pay an equal quota. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p14">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p15">In matters of contribution, it is the practice to
      waive the articles of the constitution. The danger of delay
      obliges the consenting provinces to furnish their quotas, without
      waiting for the others; and then to obtain reimbursement from the
      others, by deputations, which are frequent, or otherwise, as they
      can. The great wealth and influence of the province of Holland
      enable her to effect both these purposes. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p15">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p16">It has more than once happened, that the deficiencies
      had to be ultimately collected at the point of the bayonet; a
      thing practicable, though dreadful, in a confedracy where one of
      the members exceeds in force all the rest, and where several of
      them are too small to meditate resistance; but utterly
      impracticable in one composed of members, several of which are
      equal to each other in strength and resources, and equal singly to
      a vigorous and persevering defense. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p16">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p17">Foreign ministers, says Sir William Temple, who was
      himself a foreign minister, elude matters taken ad referendum, by
      tampering with the provinces and cities. In 1726, the treaty of
      Hanover was delayed by these means a whole year. Instances of a
      like nature are numerous and notorious. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p17">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p18">In critical emergencies, the States-General are often
      compelled to overleap their constitutional bounds. In 1688, they
      concluded a treaty of themselves at the risk of their heads. The
      treaty of Westphalia, in 1648, by which their independence was
      formerly and finally recognized, was concluded without the consent
      of Zealand. Even as recently as the last treaty of peace with
      Great Britain, the constitutional principle of unanimity was
      departed from. A weak constitution must necessarily terminate in
      dissolution, for want of proper powers, or the usurpation of
      powers requisite for the public safety. Whether the usurpation,
      when once begun, will stop at the salutary point, or go forward to
      the dangerous extreme, must depend on the contingencies of the
      moment. Tyranny has perhaps oftener grown out of the assumptions
      of power, called for, on pressing exigencies, by a defective
      constitution, than out of the full exercise of the largest
      constitutional authorities. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p18">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p19">Notwithstanding the calamities produced by the
      stadtholdership, it has been supposed that without his influence
      in the individual provinces, the causes of anarchy manifest in the
      confederacy would long ago have dissolved it. "Under such a
      government," says the Abbe Mably, "the Union could never have
      subsisted, if the provinces had not a spring within themselves,
      capable of quickening their tardiness, and compelling them to the
      same way of thinking. This spring is the stadtholder." It is
      remarked by Sir William Temple, "that in the intermissions of the
      stadtholdership, Holland, by her riches and her authority, which
      drew the others into a sort of dependence, supplied the place." <a
      class="permalink" href="#p19">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p20">These are not the only circumstances which have
      controlled the tendency to anarchy and dissolution. The
      surrounding powers impose an absolute necessity of union to a
      certain degree, at the same time that they nourish by their
      intrigues the constitutional vices which keep the republic in some
      degree always at their mercy. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p20">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p21">The true patriots have long bewailed the fatal
      tendency of these vices, and have made no less than four regular
      experiments by <em>extraordinary assemblies</em>, convened for the
      special purpose, to apply a remedy. As many times has their
      laudable zeal found it impossible to <em>unite the public
      councils</em> in reforming the known, the acknowledged, the fatal
      evils of the existing constitution. Let us pause, my
      fellow-citizens, for one moment, over this melancholy and monitory
      lesson of history; and with the tear that drops for the calamities
      brought on mankind by their adverse opinions and selfish passions,
      let our gratitude mingle an ejaculation to Heaven, for the
      propitious concord which has distinguished the consultations for
      our political happiness. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p21">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p22">A design was also conceived of establishing a general
      tax to be administered by the federal authority. This also had its
      adversaries and failed. <a class="permalink" href="#p22">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p23">This unhappy people seem to be now suffering from
      popular convulsions, from dissensions among the states, and from
      the actual invasion of foreign arms, the crisis of their distiny.
      All nations have their eyes fixed on the awful spectacle. The
      first wish prompted by humanity is, that this severe trial may
      issue in such a revolution of their government as will establish
      their union, and render it the parent of tranquillity, freedom and
      happiness: The next, that the asylum under which, we trust, the
      enjoyment of these blessings will speedily be secured in this
      country, may receive and console them for the catastrophe of their
      own. <a class="permalink" href="#p23">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p24">I make no apology for having dwelt so long on the
      contemplation of these federal precedents. Experience is the
      oracle of truth; and where its responses are unequivocal, they
      ought to be conclusive and sacred. The important truth, which it
      unequivocally pronounces in the present case, is that a
      sovereignty over sovereigns, a government over governments, a
      legislation for communities, as contradistinguished from
      individuals, as it is a solecism in theory, so in practice it is
      subversive of the order and ends of civil polity, by substituting
      <em>violence</em> in place of <em>law</em>, or the destructive
      <em>coercion</em> of the <em>sword</em> in place of the mild and
      salutary <em>coercion</em> of the <em>magistracy</em>. <a
