      The Powers of the Convention to Form a Mixed Government Examined
      and Sustained
    </h2>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><span class="initial">The second</span> point to be
      examined is, whether the convention were authorized to frame and
      propose this mixed Constitution. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">The powers of the convention ought, in strictness, to
      be determined by an inspection of the commissions given to the
      members by their respective constituents. As all of these,
      however, had reference, either to the recommendation from the
      meeting at Annapolis, in September, 1786, or to that from
      Congress, in February, 1787, it will be sufficient to recur to
      these particular acts. <a class="permalink" href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">The act from Annapolis recommends the <q>appointment of
      commissioners to take into consideration the situation of the
      United States; to devise <em>such further provisions</em> as shall
      appear to them necessary to render the Constitution of the federal
      government <em>adequate to the exigencies of the union</em>; and
      to report such an act for that purpose, to the United States in
      Congress assembled, as when agreed to by them, and afterwards
      confirmed by the legislature of every State, will effectually
      provide for the same.</q> <a class="permalink"
      href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">The recommendatory act of Congress is in the words
      following: &quot;<em>whereas</em>, There is provision in the
      articles of Confederation and perpetual Union, for making
      alterations therein, by the assent of a Congress of the United
      States, and of the legislatures of the several States; and whereas
      experience hath evinced, that there are defects in the present
      Confederation; as a mean to remedy which, several of the States,
      and <em>particularly the state of New York</em>, by express
      instructions to their delegates in Congress, have suggested a
      convention for the purposes expressed in the following resolution;
      and such convention appearing to be the most probable mean of
      establishing in these States <em>a firm national government</em>:
      <a class="permalink" href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">&quot;Resolved, That in the opinion of Congress it is
      expedient, that on the second Monday of May next a convention of
      delegates, who shall have been appointed by the several States, be
      held at Philadelphia, for the sole and express purpose <em>of
      revising the Articles of Confederation</em>, and reporting to
      Congress and the several legislatures such <em>alterations and
      provisions therein</em>, as shall, when agreed to in Congress, and
      confirmed by the States, render the federal Constitution
      <em>adequate to the exigencies of government and the preservation
      of the union</em>.&quot; <a class="permalink" href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">From these two acts, it appears, 1<sup>st</sup>, that
      the object of the convention was to establish, in these
      States, <em>a firm national government</em>; 2<sup>d</sup>, that this
      government was to be such as would be <em>adequate to the
      exigencies of government</em> and
      <em>the preservation of the union</em>; 3<sup>d</sup>, that these purposes
      were to be effected by <em>alterations and provisions in the
      Articles of Confederation</em>, as it is expressed in the act of
      Congress, or by <em>such further provisions as should appear
      necessary</em>, as it stands in the recommendatory act from
      Annapolis; 4<sup>th</sup>, that the alterations and provisions were to be
      reported to Congress, and to the States, in order to be agreed to
      by the former and confirmed by the latter. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p7">From a comparison and fair construction of these
      several modes of expression, is to be deduced the authority under
      which the convention acted. They were to frame a <em>national
      government</em>, adequate to the <em>exigencies of
      government</em>, and <em>of the union</em>; and to reduce the
      articles of Confederation into such form as to accomplish these
      purposes. <a class="permalink" href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p8">There are two rules of construction, dictated by plain
      reason, as well as founded on legal axioms. The one is, that every
      part of the expression ought, if possible, to be allowed some
      meaning, and be made to conspire to some common end. The other is,
      that where the several parts cannot be made to coincide, the less
      important should give way to the more important part; the means
      should be sacrificed to the end, rather than the end to the means.
      <a class="permalink" href="#p8">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p9">Suppose, then, that the expressions defining the
      authority of the convention were irreconcilably at variance with
      each other; that a <em>national</em> and <em>adequate
      government</em> could not possibly, in the judgment of the
      convention, be affected by <em>alterations</em> and
      <em>provisions</em> in the <em>Articles of Confederation</em>;
      which part of the definition ought to have been embraced, and
      which rejected? Which was the more important, which the less
      important part? Which the end; which the means? Let the most
      scrupulous expositors of delegated powers; let the most inveterate
      objectors against those exercised by the convention, answer these
      questions. Let them declare, whether it was of most importance to
      the happiness of the people of America, that the articles of
      Confederation should be disregarded, and an adequate government be
      provided, and the Union preserved; or that an adequate government
      should be omitted, and the articles of Confederation preserved.
      Let them declare, whether the preservation of these articles was
      the end, for securing which a reform of the government was to be
      introduced as the means; or whether the establishment of a
      government, adequate to the national happiness, was the end at
      which these articles themselves originally aimed, and to which
      they ought, as insufficient means, to have been sacrificed. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p9">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p10">But is it necessary to suppose that these expressions
      are absolutely irreconcilable to each other; that no
      <em>alterations</em> or <em>provisions</em> in <em>the Articles of
      the Confederation</em> could possibly mould them into a national
      and adequate government; into such a government as has been
      proposed by the convention? <a class="permalink"
      href="#p10">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p11">No stress, it is presumed, will, in this case, be laid
      on the <em>title</em>; a change of that could never be deemed an
      exercise of ungranted power. <em>Alterations</em> in the body of
      the instrument are expressly authorized. <em>New provisions</em>
      therein are also expressly authorized. Here then is a power to
      change the title; to insert new articles; to alter old ones. Must
      it of necessity be admitted that this power is infringed, so long
      as a part of the old articles remain? Those who maintain the
      affirmative ought at least to mark the boundary between authorized
      and usurped innovations; between that degree of change which lies
      within the compass of <em>alterations and further provisions</em>,
      and that which amounts to a <em>transmutation</em> of the
      government. Will it be said that the alterations ought not to have
      touched the substance of the Confederation? The States would never
      have appointed a convention with so much solemnity, nor described
      its objects with so much latitude, if some <em>substantial</em>
      reform had not been in contemplation. Will it be said that the
      <em>fundamental principles</em> of the Confederation were not
      within the purview of the convention, and ought not to have been
      varied? I ask, What are these principles? Do they require that, in
      the establishment of the Constitution, the States should be
      regarded as distinct and independent sovereigns? They are so
      regarded by the Constitution proposed. Do they require that the
      members of the government should derive their appointment from the
      legislatures, not from the people of the States? One branch of the
      new government is to be appointed by these legislatures; and under
      the Confederation, the delegates to Congress MAY ALL be appointed
      immediately by the people, and in two States<a class="note"
      href="#note1">1</a> are actually so appointed. Do they require
      that the powers of the government should act on the States, and
      not immediately on individuals? In some instances, as has been
      shown, the powers of the new government will act on the States in
      their collective characters. In some instances, also, those of the
      existing government act immediately on individuals. In cases of
      capture; of piracy; of the post office; of coins, weights, and
      measures; of trade with the Indians; of claims under grants of
      land by different States; and, above all, in the case of trials by
      courts-marshal in the army and navy, by which death may be
      inflicted without the intervention of a jury, or even of a civil
      magistrate; in all these cases the powers of the Confederation
      operate immediately on the persons and interests of individual
      citizens. Do these fundamental principles require, particularly,
      that no tax should be levied without the intermediate agency of
      the States? The Confederation itself authorizes a direct tax, to a
      certain extent, on the post office. The power of coinage has been
      so construed by Congress as to levy a tribute immediately from
      that source also. But pretermitting these instances, was it not an
      acknowledged object of the convention and the universal
      expectation of the people, that the regulation of trade should be
      submitted to the general government in such a form as would render
      it an immediate source of general revenue? Had not Congress
      repeatedly recommended this measure as not inconsistent with the
      fundamental principles of the Confederation? Had not every State
      but one; had not New York herself, so far complied with the plan
      of Congress as to recognize the <em>principle</em> of the
      innovation? Do these principles, in fine, require that the powers
      of the general government should be limited, and that, beyond this
      limit, the States should be left in possession of their
      sovereignty and independence? We have seen that in the new
      government, as in the old, the general powers are limited; and
      that the States, in all unenumerated cases, are left in the
      enjoyment of their sovereign and independent jurisdiction. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p11">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p12">The truth is, that the great principles of the
      Constitution proposed by the convention may be considered less as
      absolutely new, than as the expansion of principles which are
      found in the articles of Confederation. The misfortune under the
      latter system has been, that these principles are so feeble and
      confined as to justify all the charges of inefficiency which have
      been urged against it, and to require a degree of enlargement
      which gives to the new system the aspect of an entire
      transformation of the old. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p12">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p13">In one particular it is admitted that the convention
      have departed from the tenor of their commission. Instead of
      reporting a plan requiring the confirmation <em>of the
      legislatures of all the states</em>, they have reported a plan
      which is to be confirmed by the <em>people</em>, and may be
      carried into effect by <em>nine states only</em>. It is worthy of
      remark that this objection, though the most plausible, has been
      the least urged in the publications which have swarmed against the
      convention. The forbearance can only have proceeded from an
      irresistible conviction of the absurdity of subjecting the fate of
      twelve States to the perverseness or corruption of a thirteenth;
      from the example of inflexible opposition given by a
      <em>majority</em> of one sixtieth of the people of America to a
      measure approved and called for by the voice of twelve States,
      comprising fifty-nine sixtieths of the people an example still
      fresh in the memory and indignation of every citizen who has felt
      for the wounded honor and prosperity of his country. As this
      objection, therefore, has been in a manner waived by those who
      have criticised the powers of the convention, I dismiss it without
      further observation. <a class="permalink" href="#p13">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p14">The <em>third</em> point to be inquired into is, how
      far considerations of duty arising out of the case itself could
      have supplied any defect of regular authority. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p14">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p15">In the preceding inquiries the powers of the
      convention have been analyzed and tried with the same rigor, and
      by the same rules, as if they had been real and final powers for
      the establishment of a Constitution for the United States. We have
      seen in what manner they have borne the trial even on that
      supposition. It is time now to recollect that the powers were
      merely advisory and recommendatory; that they were so meant by the
      States, and so understood by the convention; and that the latter
      have accordingly planned and proposed a Constitution which is to
      be of no more consequence than the paper on which it is written,
      unless it be stamped with the approbation of those to whom it is
      addressed. This reflection places the subject in a point of view
      altogether different, and will enable us to judge with propriety
      of the course taken by the convention. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p15">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p16">Let us view the ground on which the convention stood.
      It may be collected from their proceedings, that they were deeply
      and unanimously impressed with the crisis, which had led their
      country almost with one voice to make so singular and solemn an
      experiment for correcting the errors of a system by which this
      crisis had been produced; that they were no less deeply and
      unanimously convinced that such a reform as they have proposed was
      absolutely necessary to effect the purposes of their appointment.
      It could not be unknown to them that the hopes and expectations of
      the great body of citizens, throughout this great empire, were
      turned with the keenest anxiety to the event of their
      deliberations. They had every reason to believe that the contrary
      sentiments agitated the minds and bosoms of every external and
      internal foe to the liberty and prosperity of the United States.
      They had seen in the origin and progress of the experiment, the
      alacrity with which the <em>proposition</em>, made by a single
      State (Virginia), towards a partial amendment of the
      Confederation, had been attended to and promoted. They had seen
      the <em>liberty assumed</em> by a <em>very few</em> deputies from
      a <em>very few</em> States, convened at Annapolis, of recommending
      a great and critical object, wholly foreign to their commission,
      not only justified by the public opinion, but actually carried
      into effect by twelve out of the thirteen States. They had seen,
      in a variety of instances, assumptions by Congress, not only of
      recommendatory, but of operative, powers, warranted, in the public
      estimation, by occasions and objects infinitely less urgent than
      those by which their conduct was to be governed. They must have
      reflected, that in all great changes of established governments,
      forms ought to give way to substance; that a rigid adherence in
      such cases to the former, would render nominal and nugatory the <a
      href="declaration#p4">transcendent and precious right</a> of the
      people to <q cite="declaration#p4">abolish or alter their
      governments as to them shall seem most likely to effect their
      safety and happiness,</q><a class="note" href="#note2">2</a> since
      it is impossible for the people spontaneously and universally to
      move in concert towards their object; and it is therefore
      essential that such changes be instituted by some <em>informal and
      unauthorized propositions</em>, made by some patriotic and
      respectable citizen or number of citizens. They must have
      recollected that it was by this irregular and assumed privilege of
      proposing to the people plans for their safety and happiness, that
      the States were first united against the danger with which they
      were threatened by their ancient government; that committees and
      congresses were formed for concentrating their efforts and
      defending their rights; and that <em>conventions</em> were
      <em>elected</em> in <em>the several states</em> for establishing
      the constitutions under which they are now governed; nor could it
      have been forgotten that no little ill-timed scruples, no zeal for
      adhering to ordinary forms, were anywhere seen, except in those
      who wished to indulge, under these masks, their secret enmity to
      the substance contended for. They must have borne in mind, that as
      the plan to be framed and proposed was to be submitted <em>to the
      people themselves</em>, the disapprobation of this supreme
      authority would destroy it forever; its approbation blot out
      antecedent errors and irregularities. It might even have occurred
      to them, that where a disposition to cavil prevailed, their
      neglect to execute the degree of power vested in them, and still
      more their recommendation of any measure whatever, not warranted
      by their commission, would not less excite animadversion, than a
      recommendation at once of a measure fully commensurate to the
      national exigencies. <a class="permalink" href="#p16">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p17">Had the convention, under all these impressions, and
      in the midst of all these considerations, instead of exercising a
      manly confidence in their country, by whose confidence they had
      been so peculiarly distinguished, and of pointing out a system
      capable, in their judgment, of securing its happiness, taken the
      cold and sullen resolution of disappointing its ardent hopes, of
      sacrificing substance to forms, of committing the dearest
      interests of their country to the uncertainties of delay and the
      hazard of events, let me ask the man who can raise his mind to one
      elevated conception, who can awaken in his bosom one patriotic
      emotion, what judgment ought to have been pronounced by the
      impartial world, by the friends of mankind, by every virtuous
      citizen, on the conduct and character of this assembly? Or if
      there be a man whose propensity to condemn is susceptible of no
      control, let me then ask what sentence he has in reserve for the
      twelve States who <em>usurped the power</em> of sending deputies
      to the convention, a body utterly unknown to their constitutions;
      for Congress, who recommended the appointment of this body,
      equally unknown to the Confederation; and for the State of New
      York, in particular, which first urged and then complied with this
      unauthorized interposition? <a class="permalink"
      href="#p17">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p18">But that the objectors may be disarmed of every
      pretext, it shall be granted for a moment that the convention were
      neither authorized by their commission, nor justified by
      circumstances in proposing a Constitution for their country: does
      it follow that the Constitution ought, for that reason alone, to
      be rejected? If, according to the noble precept, it be lawful to
      accept good advice even from an enemy, shall we set the ignoble
      example of refusing such advice even when it is offered by our
      friends? The prudent inquiry, in all cases, ought surely to be,
      not so much <em>from whom</em> the advice comes, as whether the
      advice be <em>good</em>. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p18">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p19">The sum of what has been here advanced and proved is,
      that the charge against the convention of exceeding their powers,
      except in one instance little urged by the objectors, has no
      foundation to support it; that if they had exceeded their powers,
      they were not only warranted, but required, as the confidential
      servants of their country, by the circumstances in which they were
      placed, to exercise the liberty which they assume; and that
      finally, if they had violated both their powers and their
      obligations, in proposing a Constitution, this ought nevertheless
      to be embraced, if it be calculated to accomplish the views and
      happiness of the people of America. How far this character is due
      to the Constitution, is the subject under investigation. <a
