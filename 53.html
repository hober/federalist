      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><span class="initial">I shall</span> here, perhaps, be
      reminded of a current observation, <q>that where annual elections
      end, tyranny begins.</q> If it be true, as has often been
      remarked, that sayings which become proverbial are generally
      founded in reason, it is not less true, that when once
      established, they are often applied to cases to which the reason
      of them does not extend. I need not look for a proof beyond the
      case before us. What is the reason on which this proverbial
      observation is founded? No man will subject himself to the
      ridicule of pretending that any natural connection subsists
      between the sun or the seasons, and the period within which human
      virtue can bear the temptations of power. Happily for mankind,
      liberty is not, in this respect, confined to any single point of
      time; but lies within extremes, which afford sufficient latitude
      for all the variations which may be required by the various
      situations and circumstances of civil society. The election of
      magistrates might be, if it were found expedient, as in some
      instances it actually has been, daily, weekly, or monthly, as well
      as annual; and if circumstances may require a deviation from the
      rule on one side, why not also on the other side? Turning our
      attention to the periods established among ourselves, for the
      election of the most numerous branches of the State legislatures,
      we find them by no means coinciding any more in this instance,
      than in the elections of other civil magistrates. In Connecticut
      and Rhode Island, the periods are half-yearly. In the other
      States, South Carolina excepted, they are annual. In South
      Carolina they are biennial as is proposed in the federal
      government. Here is a difference, as four to one, between the
      longest and shortest periods; and yet it would be not easy to
      show, that Connecticut or Rhode Island is better governed, or
      enjoys a greater share of rational liberty, than South Carolina;
      or that either the one or the other of these States is
      distinguished in these respects, and by these causes, from the
      States whose elections are different from both. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">In searching for the grounds of this doctrine, I can
      discover but one, and that is wholly inapplicable to our case. The
      important distinction so well understood in America, between a
      Constitution established by the people and unalterable by the
      government, and a law established by the government and alterable
      by the government, seems to have been little understood and less
      observed in any other country. Wherever the supreme power of
      legislation has resided, has been supposed to reside also a full
      power to change the form of the government. Even in Great Britain,
      where the principles of political and civil liberty have been most
      discussed, and where we hear most of the rights of the
      Constitution, it is maintained that the authority of the
      Parliament is transcendent and uncontrollable, as well with regard
      to the Constitution, as the ordinary objects of legislative
      provision. They have accordingly, in several instances, actually
      changed, by legislative acts, some of the most fundamental
      articles of the government. They have in particular, on several
      occasions, changed the period of election; and, on the last
      occasion, not only introduced septennial in place of triennial
      elections, but by the same act, continued themselves in place four
      years beyond the term for which they were elected by the people.
      An attention to these dangerous practices has produced a very
      natural alarm in the votaries of free government, of which
      frequency of elections is the corner-stone; and has led them to
      seek for some security to liberty, against the danger to which it
      is exposed. Where no Constitution, paramount to the government,
      either existed or could be obtained, no constitutional security,
      similar to that established in the United States, was to be
      attempted. Some other security, therefore, was to be sought for;
      and what better security would the case admit, than that of
      selecting and appealing to some simple and familiar portion of
      time, as a standard for measuring the danger of innovations, for
      fixing the national sentiment, and for uniting the patriotic
      exertions? The most simple and familiar portion of time,
      applicable to the subject was that of a year; and hence the
      doctrine has been inculcated by a laudable zeal, to erect some
      barrier against the gradual innovations of an unlimited
      government, that the advance towards tyranny was to be calculated
      by the distance of departure from the fixed point of annual
      elections. But what necessity can there be of applying this
      expedient to a government limited, as the federal government will
      be, by the authority of a paramount Constitution? Or who will
      pretend that the liberties of the people of America will not be
      more secure under biennial elections, unalterably fixed by such a
      Constitution, than those of any other nation would be, where
      elections were annual, or even more frequent, but subject to
      alterations by the ordinary power of the government? <a
      class="permalink" href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">The second question stated is, whether biennial
      elections be necessary or useful. The propriety of answering this
      question in the affirmative will appear from several very obvious
      considerations. <a class="permalink" href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">No man can be a competent legislator who does not add
      to an upright intention and a sound judgment a certain degree of
      knowledge of the subjects on which he is to legislate. A part of
      this knowledge may be acquired by means of information which lie
      within the compass of men in private as well as public stations.
      Another part can only be attained, or at least thoroughly
      attained, by actual experience in the station which requires the
      use of it. The period of service, ought, therefore, in all such
      cases, to bear some proportion to the extent of practical
      knowledge requisite to the due performance of the service. The
      period of legislative service established in most of the States
      for the more numerous branch is, as we have seen, one year. The
      question then may be put into this simple form: does the period of
      two years bear no greater proportion to the knowledge requisite
      for federal legislation than one year does to the knowledge
      requisite for State legislation? The very statement of the
      question, in this form, suggests the answer that ought to be given
      to it. <a class="permalink" href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">In a single State, the requisite knowledge relates to
      the existing laws which are uniform throughout the State, and with
      which all the citizens are more or less conversant; and to the
      general affairs of the State, which lie within a small compass,
      are not very diversified, and occupy much of the attention and
      conversation of every class of people. The great theatre of the
      United States presents a very different scene. The laws are so far
      from being uniform, that they vary in every State; whilst the
      public affairs of the Union are spread throughout a very extensive
      region, and are extremely diversified by t e local affairs
      connected with them, and can with difficulty be correctly learnt
      in any other place than in the central councils to which a
      knowledge of them will be brought by the representatives of every
      part of the empire. Yet some knowledge of the affairs, and even of
      the laws, of all the States, ought to be possessed by the members
      from each of the States. How can foreign trade be properly
      regulated by uniform laws, without some acquaintance with the
      commerce, the ports, the usages, and the regulatious of the
      different States? How can the trade between the different States
      be duly regulated, without some knowledge of their relative
      situations in these and other respects? How can taxes be
      judiciously imposed and effectually collected, if they be not
      accommodated to the different laws and local circumstances
      relating to these objects in the different States? How can uniform
      regulations for the militia be duly provided, without a similar
      knowledge of many internal circumstances by which the States are
      distinguished from each other? These are the principal objects of
      federal legislation, and suggest most forcibly the extensive
      information which the representatives ought to acquire. The other
      interior objects will require a proportional degree of information
      with regard to them. <a class="permalink" href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">It is true that all these difficulties will, by
      degrees, be very much diminished. The most laborious task will be
      the proper inauguration of the government and the primeval
      formation of a federal code. Improvements on the first draughts
      will every year become both easier and fewer. Past transactions of
      the government will be a ready and accurate source of information
      to new members. The affairs of the Union will become more and more
      objects of curiosity and conversation among the citizens at large.
      And the increased intercourse among those of different States will
      contribute not a little to diffuse a mutual knowledge of their
      affairs, as this again will contribute to a general assimilation
      of their manners and laws. But with all these abatements, the
      business of federal legislation must continue so far to exceed,
      both in novelty and difficulty, the legislative business of a
      single State, as to justify the longer period of service assigned
      to those who are to transact it. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p7">A branch of knowledge which belongs to the acquirements
      of a federal representative, and which has not been mentioned is
      that of foreign affairs. In regulating our own commerce he ought
      to be not only acquainted with the treaties between the United
      States and other nations, but also with the commercial policy and
      laws of other nations. He ought not to be altogether ignorant of
      the law of nations; for that, as far as it is a proper object of
      municipal legislation, is submitted to the federal government. And
      although the House of Representatives is not immediately to
      participate in foreign negotiations and arrangements, yet from the
      necessary connection between the several branches of public
      affairs, those particular branches will frequently deserve
      attention in the ordinary course of legislation, and will
      sometimes demand particular legislative sanction and co-operation.
      Some portion of this knowledge may, no doubt, be acquired in a
      man's closet; but some of it also can only be derived from the
      public sources of information; and all of it will be acquired to
      best effect by a practical attention to the subject during the
      period of actual service in the legislature. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p8">There are other considerations, of less importance,
      perhaps, but which are not unworthy of notice. The distance which
      many of the representatives will be obliged to travel, and the
      arrangements rendered necessary by that circumstance, might be
      much more serious objections with fit men to this service, if
      limited to a single year, than if extended to two years. No
      argument can be drawn on this subject, from the case of the
      delegates to the existing Congress. They are elected annually, it
      is true; but their re-election is considered by the legislative
      assemblies almost as a matter of course. The election of the
      representatives by the people would not be governed by the same
      principle. <a class="permalink" href="#p8">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p9">A few of the members, as happens in all such
      assemblies, will possess superior talents; will, by frequent
      reelections, become members of long standing; will be thoroughly
      masters of the public business, and perhaps not unwilling to avail
      themselves of those advantages. The greater the proportion of new
      members, and the less the information of the bulk of the members
      the more apt will they be to fall into the snares that may be laid
      for them. This remark is no less applicable to the relation which
      will subsist between the House of Representatives and the Senate.
      <a class="permalink" href="#p9">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p10">It is an inconvenience mingled with the advantages of
      our frequent elections even in single States, where they are
      large, and hold but one legislative session in a year, that
      spurious elections cannot be investigated and annulled in time for
      the decision to have its due effect. If a return can be obtained,
      no matter by what unlawful means, the irregular member, who takes
      his seat of course, is sure of holding it a sufficient time to
      answer his purposes. Hence, a very pernicious encouragement is
      given to the use of unlawful means, for obtaining irregular
      returns. Were elections for the federal legislature to be annual,
      this practice might become a very serious abuse, particularly in
      the more distant States. Each house is, as it necessarily must be,
      the judge of the elections, qualifications, and returns of its
      members; and whatever improvements may be suggested by experience,
      for simplifying and accelerating the process in disputed cases, so
      great a portion of a year would unavoidably elapse, before an
      illegitimate member could be dispossessed of his seat, that the
      prospect of such an event would be little check to unfair and
      illicit means of obtaining a seat. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p10">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p11">All these considerations taken together warrant us in
      affirming, that biennial elections will be as useful to the
      affairs of the public as we have seen that they will be safe to
      the liberty of the people. <a class="permalink"
