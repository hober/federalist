      Concerning Dangers from Dissensions Between the States
    </h3>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><span class="initial">It is</span> sometimes asked,
      with an air of seeming triumph, what inducements could the States
      have, if disunited, to make war upon each other? It would be a
      full answer to this question to say&#8212;precisely the same
      inducements which have, at different times, deluged in blood all
      the nations in the world. But, unfortunately for us, the question
      admits of a more particular answer. There are causes of
      differences within our immediate contemplation, of the tendency of
      which, even under the restraints of a federal constitution, we
      have had sufficient experience to enable us to form a judgment of
      what might be expected if those restraints were removed. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">Territorial disputes have at all times been found one
      of the most fertile sources of hostility among nations. Perhaps
      the greatest proportion of wars that have desolated the earth have
      sprung from this origin. This cause would exist among us in full
      force. We have a vast tract of unsettled territory within the
      boundaries of the United States. There still are discordant and
      undecided claims between several of them, and the dissolution of
      the Union would lay a foundation for similar claims between them
      all. It is well known that they have heretofore had serious and
      animated discussion concerning the rights to the lands which were
      ungranted at the time of the Revolution, and which usually went
      under the name of crown lands. The States within the limits of
      whose colonial governments they were comprised have claimed them
      as their property, the others have contended that the rights of
      the crown in this article devolved upon the Union; especially as
      to all that part of the Western territory which, either by actual
      possession, or through the submission of the Indian proprietors,
      was subjected to the jurisdiction of the king of Great Britain,
      till it was relinquished in the treaty of peace. This, it has been
      said, was at all events an acquisition to the Confederacy by
      compact with a foreign power. It has been the prudent policy of
      Congress to appease this controversy, by prevailing upon the
      States to make cessions to the United States for the benefit of
      the whole. This has been so far accomplished as, under a
      continuation of the Union, to afford a decided prospect of an
      amicable termination of the dispute. A dismemberment of the
      Confederacy, however, would revive this dispute, and would create
      others on the same subject. At present, a large part of the vacant
      Western territory is, by cession at least, if not by any anterior
      right, the common property of the Union. If that were at an end,
      the States which made the cession, on a principle of federal
      compromise, would be apt when the motive of the grant had ceased,
      to reclaim the lands as a reversion. The other States would no
      doubt insist on a proportion, by right of representation. Their
      argument would be, that a grant, once made, could not be revoked;
      and that the justice of participating in territory acquired or
      secured by the joint efforts of the Confederacy, remained
      undiminished. If, contrary to probability, it should be admitted
      by all the States, that each had a right to a share of this common
      stock, there would still be a difficulty to be surmounted, as to a
      proper rule of apportionment. Different principles would be set up
      by different States for this purpose; and as they would affect the
      opposite interests of the parties, they might not easily be
      susceptible of a pacific adjustment. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">In the wide field of Western territory, therefore, we
      perceive an ample theatre for hostile pretensions, without any
      umpire or common judge to interpose between the contending
      parties. To reason from the past to the future, we shall have good
      ground to apprehend, that the sword would sometimes be appealed to
      as the arbiter of their differences. The circumstances of <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennamite_Wars">the dispute
      between Connecticut and Pennsylvania</a>, respecting <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyoming_Valley">the land at
      Wyoming</a>, admonish us not to be sanguine in expecting an easy
      accommodation of such differences. The <a
      href="articles">Articles of Confederation</a> obliged the
      parties to submit the matter to the decision of a federal court.
      The submission was made, and the court decided in favor of
      Pennsylvania. But Connecticut gave strong indications of
      dissatisfaction with that determination; nor did she appear to be
      entirely resigned to it, till, by negotiation and management,
      something like an equivalent was found for the loss she supposed
      herself to have sustained. Nothing here said is intended to convey
      the slightest censure on the conduct of that State. She no doubt
      sincerely believed herself to have been injured by the decision;
      and States, like individuals, acquiesce with great reluctance in
      determinations to their disadvantage. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">Those who had an opportunity of seeing the inside of
      the transactions which attended the progress of <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hampshire_Grants">the
      controversy between this State and the district of Vermont</a>,
      can vouch the opposition we experienced, as well from States not
      interested as from those which were interested in the claim; and
      can attest the danger to which the peace of the Confederacy might
      have been exposed, had this State attempted to assert its rights
      by force. Two motives preponderated in that opposition: one, a
      jealousy entertained of our future power; and the other, the
      interest of certain individuals of influence in the neighboring
      States, who had obtained grants of lands under the actual
      government of that district. Even the States which brought forward
      claims, in contradiction to ours, seemed more solicitous to
      dismember this State, than to establish their own pretensions.
      These were New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. New
      Jersey and Rhode Island, upon all occasions, discovered a warm
      zeal for the independence of Vermont; and Maryland, till alarmed
      by the appearance of a connection between Canada and that State,
      entered deeply into the same views. These being small States, saw
      with an unfriendly eye the perspective of our growing greatness.
      In a review of these transactions we may trace some of the causes
      which would be likely to embroil the States with each other, if it
      should be their unpropitious destiny to become disunited. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">The competitions of commerce would be another fruitful
      source of contention. The States less favorably circumstanced
      would be desirous of escaping from the disadvantages of local
      situation, and of sharing in the advantages of their more
      fortunate neighbors. Each State, or separate confederacy, would
      pursue a system of commercial policy peculiar to itself. This
      would occasion distinctions, preferences, and exclusions, which
      would beget discontent. The habits of intercourse, on the basis of
      equal privileges, to which we have been accustomed since the
      earliest settlement of the country, would give a keener edge to
      those causes of discontent than they would naturally have
      independent of this circumstance. <em>We should be ready to
      denominate injuries those things which were in reality the
      justifiable acts of independent sovereignties consulting a
      distinct interest</em>. The spirit of enterprise, which
      characterizes the commercial part of America, has left no occasion
      of displaying itself unimproved. It is not at all probable that
      this unbridled spirit would pay much respect to those regulations
      of trade by which particular States might endeavor to secure
      exclusive benefits to their own citizens. The infractions of these
      regulations, on one side, the efforts to prevent and repel them,
      on the other, would naturally lead to outrages, and these to
      reprisals and wars. <a class="permalink" href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">The opportunities which some States would have of
      rendering others tributary to them by commercial regulations would
      be impatiently submitted to by the tributary States. The relative
      situation of New York, Connecticut, and New Jersey would afford an
      example of this kind. New York, from the necessities of revenue,
      must lay duties on her importations. A great part of these duties
      must be paid by the inhabitants of the two other States in the
      capacity of consumers of what we import. New York would neither be
      willing nor able to forego this advantage. Her citizens would not
      consent that a duty paid by them should be remitted in favor of
      the citizens of her neighbors; nor would it be practicable, if
      there were not this impediment in the way, to distinguish the
      customers in our own markets. Would Connecticut and New Jersey
      long submit to be taxed by New York for her exclusive benefit?
      Should we be long permitted to remain in the quiet and undisturbed
      enjoyment of a metropolis, from the possession of which we derived
      an advantage so odious to our neighbors, and, in their opinion, so
      oppressive? Should we be able to preserve it against the incumbent
      weight of Connecticut on the one side, and the co-operating
      pressure of New Jersey on the other? These are questions that
      temerity alone will answer in the affirmative. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p7">The public debt of the Union would be a further cause
      of collision between the separate States or confederacies. The
      apportionment, in the first instance, and the progressive
      extinguishment afterward, would be alike productive of ill-humor
      and animosity. How would it be possible to agree upon a rule of
      apportionment satisfactory to all? There is scarcely any that can
      be proposed which is entirely free from real objections. These, as
      usual, would be exaggerated by the adverse interest of the
      parties. There are even dissimilar views among the States as to
      the general principle of discharging the public debt. Some of
      them, either less impressed with the importance of national
      credit, or because their citizens have little, if any, immediate
      interest in the question, feel an indifference, if not a
      repugnance, to the payment of the domestic debt at any rate. These
      would be inclined to magnify the difficulties of a distribution.
      Others of them, a numerous body of whose citizens are creditors to
      the public beyond proportion of the State in the total amount of
      the national debt, would be strenuous for some equitable and
      effective provision. The procrastinations of the former would
      excite the resentments of the latter. The settlement of a rule
      would, in the meantime, be postponed by real differences of
      opinion and affected delays. The citizens of the States interested
      would clamour; foreign powers would urge for the satisfaction of
      their just demands, and the peace of the States would be hazarded
      to the double contingency of external invasion and internal
      contention. <a class="permalink" href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p8">Suppose the difficulties of agreeing upon a rule
      surmounted, and the apportionment made. Still there is great room
      to suppose that the rule agreed upon would, upon experiment, be
      found to bear harder upon some States than upon others. Those
      which were sufferers by it would naturally seek for a mitigation
      of the burden. The others would as naturally be disinclined to a
      revision, which was likely to end in an increase of their own
      incumbrances. Their refusal would be too plausible a pretext to
      the complaining States to withhold their contributions, not to be
      embraced with avidity; and the non-compliance of these States with
      their engagements would be a ground of bitter discussion and
      altercation. If even the rule adopted should in practice justify
      the equality of its principle, still delinquencies in payments on
      the part of some of the States would result from a diversity of
      other causes&#8212;the real deficiency of resources; the
      mismanagement of their finances; accidental disorders in the
      management of the government; and, in addition to the rest, the
      reluctance with which men commonly part with money for purposes
      that have outlived the exigencies which produced them, and
      interfere with the supply of immediate wants. Delinquencies, from
      whatever causes, would be productive of complaints,
      recriminations, and quarrels. There is, perhaps, nothing more
      likely to disturb the tranquillity of nations than their being
      bound to mutual contributions for any common object that does not
      yield an equal and coincident benefit. For it is an observation,
      as true as it is trite, that there is nothing men differ so
      readily about as the payment of money. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p8">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p9">Laws in violation of private contracts, as they amount
      to aggressions on the rights of those States whose citizens are
      injured by them, may be considered as another probable source of
      hostility. We are not authorized to expect that a more liberal or
      more equitable spirit would preside over the legislations of the
      individual States hereafter, if unrestrained by any additional
      checks, than we have heretofore seen in too many instances
      disgracing their several codes. We have observed the disposition
      to retaliation excited in Connecticut in consequence of the
      enormities perpetrated by the Legislature of Rhode Island; and we
      reasonably infer that, in similar cases, under other
      circumstances, a war, not of <em>parchment</em>, but of the sword,
      would chastise such atrocious breaches of moral obligation and
      social justice. <a class="permalink" href="#p9">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p10">The probability of incompatible alliances between the
      different States or confederacies and different foreign nations,
      and the effects of this situation upon the peace of the whole,
      have been sufficiently unfolded in some preceding papers. From the
      view they have exhibited of this part of the subject, this
      conclusion is to be drawn, that America, if not connected at all,
      or only by the feeble tie of a simple league, offensive and
      defensive, would, by the operation of such jarring alliances, be
      gradually entangled in all the pernicious labyrinths of European
      politics and wars; and by the destructive contentions of the parts
      into which she was divided, would be likely to become a prey to
      the artifices and machinations of powers equally the enemies of
      them all. Divide et impera<a class="note" href="#note1">1</a> must
      be the motto of every nation that either hates or fears us.<a
