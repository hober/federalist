      Objections to the Power of the Senate To Set as a Court for
      Impeachments Further Considered
    </h2>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><span class="initial">A review</span> of the principal
      objections that have appeared against <a
      href="constitution#a1s3c6">the proposed court for the trial of
      impeachments</a>, will not improbably eradicate the remains of any
      unfavorable impressions which may still exist in regard to this
      matter. <a class="permalink" href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">The <em>first</em> of these objections is, that the
      provision in question confounds legislative and judiciary
      authorities in the same body, in violation of that important and
      wellestablished maxim which requires a separation between the
      different departments of power. The true meaning of this maxim has
      been discussed and ascertained in another place, and has been
      shown to be entirely compatible with a partial intermixture of
      those departments for special purposes, preserving them, in the
      main, distinct and unconnected. This partial intermixture is even,
      in some cases, not only proper but necessary to the mutual defense
      of the several members of the government against each other. An
      absolute or qualified negative in the executive upon the acts of
      the legislative body, is admitted, by the ablest adepts in
      political science, to be an indispensable barrier against the
      encroachments of the latter upon the former. And it may, perhaps,
      with no less reason be contended, that the powers relating to
      impeachments are, as before intimated, an essential check in the
      hands of that body upon the encroachments of the executive. The
      division of them between the two branches of the legislature,
      assigning to one the right of accusing, to the other the right of
      judging, avoids the inconvenience of making the same persons both
      accusers and judges; and guards against the danger of persecution,
      from the prevalency of a factious spirit in either of those
      branches. As the concurrence of two thirds of the Senate will be
      requisite to a condemnation, the security to innocence, from this
      additional circumstance, will be as complete as itself can desire.
      <a class="permalink" href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">It is curious to observe, with what vehemence this part
      of the plan is assailed, on the principle here taken notice of, by
      men who profess to admire, without exception, <a
      href="http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/states/ny01.htm">the
      constitution of this State</a>; while that constitution makes the
      Senate, together with the chancellor and judges of the Supreme
      Court, not only a court of impeachments, but the highest
      judicatory in the State, in all causes, civil and criminal. The
      proportion, in point of numbers, of the chancellor and judges to
      the senators, is so inconsiderable, that the judiciary authority
      of New York, in the last resort, may, with truth, be said to
      reside in its Senate. If the plan of the convention be, in this
      respect, chargeable with a departure from the celebrated maxim
      which has been so often mentioned, and seems to be so little
      understood, how much more culpable must be the constitution of New
      York?<a class="note" href="#note1">1</a> <a class="permalink"
      href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">A <em>second</em> objection to the Senate, as a court
      of impeachments, is, that it contributes to an undue accumulation
      of power in that body, tending to give to the government a
      countenance too aristocratic. The Senate, it is observed, is to
      have concurrent authority with the Executive in the formation of
      treaties and in the appointment to offices: if, say the objectors,
      to these prerogatives is added that of deciding in all cases of
      impeachment, it will give a decided predominancy to senatorial
      influence. To an objection so little precise in itself, it is not
      easy to find a very precise answer. Where is the measure or
      criterion to which we can appeal, for determining what will give
      the Senate too much, too little, or barely the proper degree of
      influence? Will it not be more safe, as well as more simple, to
      dismiss such vague and uncertain calculations, to examine each
      power by itself, and to decide, on general principles, where it
      may be deposited with most advantage and least inconvenience? <a
      class="permalink" href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">If we take this course, it will lead to a more
      intelligible, if not to a more certain result. The disposition of
      the power of making treaties, which has obtained in the plan of
      the convention, will, then, if I mistake not, appear to be fully
      justified by <a href="64">the considerations stated in a former
      number</a>, and by others which will occur under the next head of
      our inquiries. The expediency of the junction of the Senate with
      the Executive, in <a href="constitution#a2s2c2">the power of
      appointing to offices</a>, will, I trust, be placed in a light not
      less satisfactory, in the disquisitions under the same head. And I
      flatter myself the observations in <a href="65">my last paper</a>
      must have gone no inconsiderable way towards proving that it was
      not easy, if practicable, to find a more fit receptacle for the
      power of determining impeachments, than that which has been
      chosen. If this be truly the case, the hypothetical dread of the
      too great weight of the Senate ought to be discarded from our
      reasonings. <a class="permalink" href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">But this hypothesis, such as it is, has already been
      refuted in the remarks applied to the duration in office
      prescribed for the senators. It was by them shown, as well on the
      credit of historical examples, as from the reason of the thing,
      that the most <em>popular</em> branch of every government,
      partaking of the republican genius, by being generally the
      favorite of the people, will be as generally a full match, if not
      an overmatch, for every other member of the Government. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p7">But independent of this most active and operative
      principle, to secure the equilibrium of the national House of
      Representatives, the plan of the convention has provided in its
      favor several important counterpoises to the additional
      authorities to be conferred upon the Senate. The exclusive
      privilege of originating money bills will belong to the House of
      Representatives. The same house will possess the sole right of
      instituting impeachments: is not this a complete counterbalance to
      that of determining them? The same house will be the umpire in all
      elections of the President, which do not unite the suffrages of a
      majority of the whole number of electors; a case which it cannot
      be doubted will sometimes, if not frequently, happen. The constant
      possibility of the thing must be a fruitful source of influence to
      that body. The more it is contemplated, the more important will
      appear this ultimate though contingent power, of deciding the
      competitions of the most illustrious citizens of the Union, for
      the first office in it. It would not perhaps be rash to predict,
      that as a mean of influence it will be found to outweigh all the
      peculiar attributes of the Senate. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p8">A <em>third</em> objection to the Senate as a court of
      impeachments, is drawn from <a href="constitution#a2s2c2">the
      agency they are to have</a> in the appointments to office. It is
      imagined that they would be too indulgent judges of the conduct of
      men, in whose official creation they had participated. The
      principle of this objection would condemn a practice, which is to
      be seen in all the State governments, if not in all the
      governments with which we are acquainted: I mean that of rendering
      those who hold offices during pleasure, dependent on the pleasure
      of those who appoint them. With equal plausibility might it be
      alleged in this case, that the favoritism of the latter would
      always be an asylum for the misbehavior of the former. But that
      practice, in contradiction to this principle, proceeds upon the
      presumption, that the responsibility of those who appoint, for the
      fitness and competency of the persons on whom they bestow their
      choice, and the interest they will have in the respectable and
      prosperous administration of affairs, will inspire a sufficient
      disposition to dismiss from a share in it all such who, by their
      conduct, shall have proved themselves unworthy of the confidence
      reposed in them. Though facts may not always correspond with this
      presumption, yet if it be, in the main, just, it must destroy the
      supposition that the Senate, who will merely sanction the choice
      of the Executive, should feel a bias, towards the objects of that
      choice, strong enough to blind them to the evidences of guilt so
      extraordinary, as to have induced the representatives of the
      nation to become its accusers. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p8">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p9">If any further arguments were necessary to evince the
      improbability of such a bias, it might be found in the nature of
      the agency of the Senate in the business of appointments. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p9">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p10">It will be the office of the President to
      <em>nominate</em>, and, <a href="constitution#a2s2c2">with the
      advice and consent of the Senate</a>, to <em>appoint</em>. There
      will, of course, be no exertion of <em>choice</em> on the part of
      the Senate. They may defeat one choice of the Executive, and
      oblige him to make another; but they cannot themselves
      <em>choose</em>, they can only ratify or reject the choice of the
      President. They might even entertain a preference to some other
      person, at the very moment they were assenting to the one
      proposed, because there might be no positive ground of opposition
      to him; and they could not be sure, if they withheld their assent,
      that the subsequent nomination would fall upon their own favorite,
      or upon any other person in their estimation more meritorious than
      the one rejected. Thus it could hardly happen, that the majority
      of the Senate would feel any other complacency towards the object
      of an appointment than such as the appearances of merit might
      inspire, and the proofs of the want of it destroy. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p10">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p11">A <em>fourth</em> objection to the Senate in the
      capacity of a court of impeachments, is derived from its union
      with the Executive in the power of making treaties. This, it has
      been said, would constitute the senators their own judges, in
      every case of a corrupt or perfidious execution of that trust.
      After having combined with the Executive in betraying the
      interests of the nation in a ruinous treaty, what prospect, it is
      asked, would there be of their being made to suffer the punishment
      they would deserve, when they were themselves to decide upon the
      accusation brought against them for the treachery of which they
      have been guilty? <a class="permalink" href="#p11">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p12">This objection has been circulated with more
      earnestness and with greater show of reason than any other which
      has appeared against this part of the plan; and yet I am deceived
      if it does not rest upon an erroneous foundation. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p12">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p13">The security essentially intended by the Constitution
      against corruption and treachery in the formation of treaties, is
      to be sought for in the numbers and characters of those who are to
      make them. The <em>joint agency</em> of the Chief Magistrate of
      the Union, and of two thirds of the members of a body selected by
      the collective wisdom of the legislatures of the several States,
      is designed to be the pledge for the fidelity of the national
      councils in this particular. The convention might with propriety
      have meditated the punishment of the Executive, for a deviation
      from the instructions of the Senate, or a want of integrity in the
      conduct of the negotiations committed to him; they might also have
      had in view the punishment of a few leading individuals in the
      Senate, who should have prostituted their influence in that body
      as the mercenary instruments of foreign corruption: but they could
      not, with more or with equal propriety, have contemplated the
      impeachment and punishment of two thirds of the Senate, consenting
      to an improper treaty, than of a majority of that or of the other
      branch of the national legislature, consenting to a pernicious or
      unconstitutional law, a principle which, I believe, has never been
      admitted into any government. How, in fact, could a majority in
      the House of Representatives impeach themselves? Not better, it is
      evident, than two thirds of the Senate might try themselves. And
      yet what reason is there, that a majority of the House of
      Representatives, sacrificing the interests of the society by an
      unjust and tyrannical act of legislation, should escape with
      impunity, more than two thirds of the Senate, sacrificing the same
      interests in an injurious treaty with a foreign power? The truth
      is, that in all such cases it is essential to the freedom and to
      the necessary independence of the deliberations of the body, that
      the members of it should be exempt from punishment for acts done
      in a collective capacity; and the security to the society must
      depend on the care which is taken to confide the trust to proper
      hands, to make it their interest to execute it with fidelity, and
      to make it as difficult as possible for them to combine in any
      interest opposite to that of the public good. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p13">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p14">So far as might concern the misbehavior of the
      Executive in perverting the instructions or contravening the views
      of the Senate, we need not be apprehensive of the want of a
      disposition in that body to punish the abuse of their confidence
      or to vindicate their own authority. We may thus far count upon
      their pride, if not upon their virtue. And so far even as might
      concern the corruption of leading members, by whose arts and
      influence the majority may have been inveigled into measures
      odious to the community, if the proofs of that corruption should
      be satisfactory, the usual propensity of human nature will warrant
      us in concluding that there would be commonly no defect of
      inclination in the body to divert the public resentment from
      themselves by a ready sacrifice of the authors of their
      mismanagement and disgrace. <a class="permalink"
