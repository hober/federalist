      Periodical Appeals to the People Considered
    </h2>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><span class="initial">It may</span> be contended,
      perhaps, that instead of <em>occasional</em> appeals to the
      people, which are liable to the objections urged against them,
      <em>periodical</em> appeals are the proper and adequate means of
      <em>preventing and correcting infractions of the
      constitution</em>. <a class="permalink" href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">It will be attended to, that in the examination of
      these expedients, I confine myself to their aptitude for
      <em>enforcing</em> the Constitution, by keeping the several
      departments of power within their due bounds, without particularly
      considering them as provisions for <em>altering</em> the
      Constitution itself. In the first view, appeals to the people at
      fixed periods appear to be nearly as ineligible as appeals on
      particular occasions as they emerge. If the periods be separated
      by short intervals, the measures to be reviewed and rectified will
      have been of recent date, and will be connected with all the
      circumstances which tend to vitiate and pervert the result of
      occasional revisions. If the periods be distant from each other,
      the same remark will be applicable to all recent measures; and in
      proportion as the remoteness of the others may favor a
      dispassionate review of them, this advantage is inseparable from
      inconveniences which seem to counterbalance it. In the first
      place, a distant prospect of public censure would be a very feeble
      restraint on power from those excesses to which it might be urged
      by the force of present motives. Is it to be imagined that a
      legislative assembly, consisting of a hundred or two hundred
      members, eagerly bent on some favorite object, and breaking
      through the restraints of the Constitution in pursuit of it, would
      be arrested in their career, by considerations drawn from a
      censorial revision of their conduct at the future distance of ten,
      fifteen, or twenty years? In the next place, the abuses would
      often have completed their mischievous effects before the remedial
      provision would be applied. And in the last place, where this
      might not be the case, they would be of long standing, would have
      taken deep root, and would not easily be extirpated. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">The scheme of revising the constitution, in order to
      correct recent breaches of it, as well as for other purposes, has
      been actually tried in one of the States. One of the objects of
      the Council of Censors which met in Pennsylvania in 1783 and 1784,
      was, as we have seen, to inquire, <q>whether the constitution had
      been violated, and whether the legislative and executive
      departments had encroached upon each other.</q> This important and
      novel experiment in politics merits, in several points of view,
      very particular attention. In some of them it may, perhaps, as a
      single experiment, made under circumstances somewhat peculiar, be
      thought to be not absolutely conclusive. But as applied to the
      case under consideration, it involves some facts, which I venture
      to remark, as a complete and satisfactory illustration of the
      reasoning which I have employed. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">First. It appears, from the names of the gentlemen who
      composed the council, that some, at least, of its most active
      members had also been active and leading characters in the parties
      which pre-existed in the State. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">Secondly. It appears that the same active and leading
      members of the council had been active and influential members of
      the legislative and executive branches, within the period to be
      reviewed; and even patrons or opponents of the very measures to be
      thus brought to the test of the constitution. Two of the members
      had been vice-presidents of the State, and several other members
      of the executive council, within the seven preceding years. One of
      them had been speaker, and a number of others distinguished
      members, of the legislative assembly within the same period. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">Thirdly. Every page of their proceedings witnesses the
      effect of all these circumstances on the temper of their
      deliberations. Throughout the continuance of the council, it was
      split into two fixed and violent parties. The fact is acknowledged
      and lamented by themselves. Had this not been the case, the face
      of their proceedings exhibits a proof equally satisfactory. In all
      questions, however unimportant in themselves, or unconnected with
      each other, the same names stand invariably contrasted on the
      opposite columns. Every unbiased observer may infer, without
      danger of mistake, and at the same time without meaning to reflect
      on either party, or any individuals of either party, that,
      unfortunately, <em>passion</em>, not <em>reason</em>, must have
      presided over their decisions. When men exercise their reason
      coolly and freely on a variety of distinct questions, they
      inevitably fall into different opinions on some of them. When they
      are governed by a common passion, their opinions, if they are so
      to be called, will be the same. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p7">Fourthly. It is at least problematical, whether the
      decisions of this body do not, in several instances, misconstrue
      the limits prescribed for the legislative and executive
      departments, instead of reducing and limiting them within their
      constitutional places. <a class="permalink" href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p8">Fifthly. I have never understood that the decisions of
      the council on constitutional questions, whether rightly or
      erroneously formed, have had any effect in varying the practice
      founded on legislative constructions. It even appears, if I
      mistake not, that in one instance the contemporary legislature
      denied the constructions of the council, and actually prevailed in
      the contest. <a class="permalink" href="#p8">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p9">This censorial body, therefore, proves at the same
      time, by its researches, the existence of the disease, and by its
      example, the inefficacy of the remedy. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p9">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p10">This conclusion cannot be invalidated by alleging that
      the State in which the experiment was made was at that crisis, and
      had been for a long time before, violently heated and distracted
      by the rage of party. Is it to be presumed, that at any future
      septennial epoch the same State will be free from parties? Is it
      to be presumed that any other State, at the same or any other
      given period, will be exempt from them? Such an event ought to be
      neither presumed nor desired; because an extinction of parties
      necessarily implies either a universal alarm for the public
      safety, or an absolute extinction of liberty. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p10">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p11">Were the precaution taken of excluding from the
      assemblies elected by the people, to revise the preceding
      administration of the government, all persons who should have been
      concerned with the government within the given period, the
      difficulties would not be obviated. The important task would
      probably devolve on men, who, with inferior capacities, would in
      other respects be little better qualified. Although they might not
      have been personally concerned in the administration, and
      therefore not immediately agents in the measures to be examined,
      they would probably have been involved in the parties connected
      with these measures, and have been elected under their auspices.
