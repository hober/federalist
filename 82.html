    <h2 class="entry-summary">The Judiciary Continued</h2>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><span class="initial">The</span> erection of a new
      government, whatever care or wisdom may distinguish the work,
      cannot fail to originate questions of intricacy and nicety; and
      these may, in a particular manner, be expected to flow from the
      establishment of a constitution founded upon the total or partial
      incorporation of a number of distinct sovereignties. 'T is time
      only that can mature and perfect so compound a system, can
      liquidate the meaning of all the parts, and can adjust them to
      each other in a harmonious and consistent <em>whole</em>. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">Such questions, accordingly, have arisen upon the plan
      proposed by the convention, and particularly concerning the
      judiciary department. The principal of these respect the situation
      of the State courts in regard to those causes which are to be
      submitted to federal jurisdiction. Is this to be exclusive, or are
      those courts to possess a concurrent jurisdiction? If the latter,
      in what relation will they stand to the national tribunals? These
      are inquiries which we meet with in the mouths of men of sense,
      and which are certainly entitled to attention. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">The principles established in a former paper<a
      class="note" href="#note1">1</a> teach us that the States will
      retain all <em>pre-existing</em> authorities which may not be
      exclusively delegated to the federal head; and that this exclusive
      delegation can only exist in one of three cases: where an
      exclusive authority is, in express terms, granted to the Union; or
      where a particular authority is granted to the Union, and the
      exercise of a like authority is prohibited to the States; or where
      an authority is granted to the Union, with which a similar
      authority in the States would be utterly incompatible. Though
      these principles may not apply with the same force to the
      judiciary as to the legislative power, yet I am inclined to think
      that they are, in the main, just with respect to the former, as
      well as the latter. And under this impression, I shall lay it down
      as a rule, that the State courts will <em>retain</em> the
      jurisdiction they now have, unless it appears to be taken away in
      one of the enumerated modes. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">The only thing in the proposed Constitution, which
      wears the appearance of confining the causes of federal cognizance
      to the federal courts, is contained <a href="constitution#a3s1">in
      this passage</a>: <q cite="constitution#a3s1">The <em>judicial
      power</em> of the United States <em>shall be vested</em> in one
      Supreme Court, and in <em>such</em> inferior courts as the
      Congress shall from time to time ordain and establish.</q> This
      might either be construed to signify, that the supreme and
      subordinate courts of the Union should alone have the power of
      deciding those causes to which their authority is to extend; or
      simply to denote, that the organs of the national judiciary should
      be one Supreme Court, and as many subordinate courts as Congress
      should think proper to appoint; or in other words, that the United
      States should exercise the judicial power with which they are to
      be invested, through one supreme tribunal, and a certain number of
      inferior ones, to be instituted by them. The first excludes, the
      last admits, the concurrent jurisdiction of the State tribunals;
      and as the first would amount to an alienation of State power by
      implication, the last appears to me the most natural and the most
      defensible construction. <a class="permalink" href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">But this doctrine of concurrent jurisdiction is only
      clearly applicable to those descriptions of causes of which the
      State courts have previous cognizance. It is not equally evident
      in relation to cases which may grow out of, and be
      <em>peculiar</em> to, the Constitution to be established; for not
      to allow the State courts a right of jurisdiction in such cases,
      can hardly be considered as the abridgment of a pre-existing
      authority. I mean not therefore to contend that the United States,
      in the course of legislation upon the objects intrusted to their
      direction, may not commit the decision of causes arising upon a
      particular regulation to the federal courts solely, if such a
      measure should be deemed expedient; but I hold that the State
      courts will be divested of no part of their primitive
      jurisdiction, further than may relate to an appeal; and I am even
      of opinion that in every case in which they were not expressly
      excluded by the future acts of the national legislature, they will
      of course take cognizance of the causes to which those acts may
      give birth. This I infer from the nature of judiciary power, and
      from the general genius of the system. The judiciary power of
      every government looks beyond its own local or municipal laws, and
      in civil cases lays hold of all subjects of litigation between
      parties within its jurisdiction, though the causes of dispute are
      relative to the laws of the most distant part of the globe. Those
      of Japan, not less than of New York, may furnish the objects of
      legal discussion to our courts. When in addition to this we
      consider the State governments and the national governments, as
      they truly are, in the light of kindred systems, and as parts of
      <em>one whole</em>, the inference seems to be conclusive, that the
      State courts would have a concurrent jurisdiction in all cases
      arising under the laws of the Union, where it was not expressly
      prohibited. <a class="permalink" href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">Here another question occurs: What relation would
      subsist between the national and State courts in these instances
      of concurrent jurisdiction? I answer, that an appeal would
      certainly lie from the latter, to the Supreme Court of the United
      States. The Constitution in direct terms gives an appellate
      jurisdiction to the Supreme Court in all the enumerated cases of
      federal cognizance in which it is not to have an original one,
      without a single expression to confine its operation to the
      inferior federal courts. The objects of appeal, not the tribunals
      from which it is to be made, are alone contemplated. From this
      circumstance, and from the reason of the thing, it ought to be
      construed to extend to the State tribunals. Either this must be
      the case, or the local courts must be excluded from a concurrent
      jurisdiction in matters of national concern, else the judiciary
      authority of the Union may be eluded at the pleasure of every
      plaintiff or prosecutor. Neither of these consequences ought,
      without evident necessity, to be involved; the latter would be
      entirely inadmissible, as it would defeat some of the most
      important and avowed purposes of the proposed government, and
      would essentially embarrass its measures. Nor do I perceive any
      foundation for such a supposition. Agreeably to the remark already
      made, the national and State systems are to be regarded as <em>one
      whole</em>. The courts of the latter will of course be natural
      auxiliaries to the execution of the laws of the Union, and an
      appeal from them will as naturally lie to that tribunal which is
      destined to unite and assimilate the principles of national
      justice and the rules of national decisions. The evident aim of
      the plan of the convention is, that all the causes of the
      specified classes shall, for weighty public reasons, receive their
      original or final determination in the courts of the Union. To
      confine, therefore, the general expressions giving appellate
      jurisdiction to the Supreme Court, to appeals from the subordinate
      federal courts, instead of allowing their extension to the State
      courts, would be to abridge the latitude of the terms, in
      subversion of the intent, contrary to every sound rule of
      interpretation. <a class="permalink" href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p7">But could an appeal be made to lie from the State
      courts to the subordinate federal judicatories? This is another of
      the questions which have been raised, and of greater difficulty
      than the former. The following considerations countenance the
      affirmative. The plan of the convention, in the first place, <a
      href="constitution#a1s8c9">authorizes</a> the national legislature
      <q cite="constitution#a1s8c9">to constitute tribunals inferior to
      the Supreme Court.</q><a class="note" href="#note2">2</a> It
      declares, in <a href="constitution#a3s1">the next place</a>, that
      <q cite="constitution#a3s1">the <em>judicial power</em> of the
      United States <em>shall be vested</em> in one Supreme Court, and
      in such inferior courts as Congress shall ordain and
      establish</q>; and it then proceeds to enumerate the cases to
      which this judicial power shall extend. It afterwards divides the
      jurisdiction of the Supreme Court into original and appellate, but
      gives no definition of that of the subordinate courts. <a
      href="constitution#a1s8c9">The only outlines described for
      them</a>, are that they shall be <q
      cite="constitution#a1s8c9">inferior to the Supreme Court,</q> and
      that they shall not exceed the specified limits of the federal
      judiciary. Whether their authority shall be original or appellate,
      or both, is not declared. All this seems to be left to the
      discretion of the legislature. And this being the case, I perceive
      at present no impediment to the establishment of an appeal from
      the State courts to the subordinate national tribunals; and many
      advantages attending the power of doing it may be imagined. It
      would diminish the motives to the multiplication of federal
      courts, and would admit of arrangements calculated to contract the
      appellate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. The State tribunals
      may then be left with a more entire charge of federal causes; and
      appeals, in most cases in which they may be deemed proper, instead
      of being carried to the Supreme Court, may be made to lie from the
      State courts to district courts of the Union. <a class="permalink"
