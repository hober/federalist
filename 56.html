      The Total Number of the House of Representatives
    </h3>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><span class="initial">The second</span> charge against
      the House of Representatives is, that it will be too small to
      possess a due knowledge of the interests of its constituents. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">As this objection evidently proceeds from a comparison
      of <a href="constitution#a1s2c3">the proposed number of
      representatives</a> with the great extent of the United States,
      the number of their inhabitants, and the diversity of their
      interests, without taking into view at the same time the
      circumstances which will distinguish the Congress from other
      legislative bodies, the best answer that can be given to it will
      be a brief explanation of these peculiarities. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">It is a sound and important principle that the
      representative ought to be acquainted with the interests and
      circumstances of his constituents. But this principle can extend
      no further than to those circumstances and interests to which the
      authority and care of the representative relate. An ignorance of a
      variety of minute and particular objects, which do not lie within
      the compass of legislation, is consistent with every attribute
      necessary to a due performance of the legislative trust. In
      determining the extent of information required in the exercise of
      a particular authority, recourse then must be had to the objects
      within the purview of that authority. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">What are to be the objects of federal legislation?
      Those which are of most importance, and which seem most to require
      local knowledge, are commerce, taxation, and the militia. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">A proper regulation of commerce requires much
      information, as has been elsewhere remarked; but as far as this
      information relates to the laws and local situation of each
      individual State, a very few representatives would be very
      sufficient vehicles of it to the federal councils. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">Taxation will consist, in a great measure, of duties
      which will be involved in the regulation of commerce. So far the
      preceding remark is applicable to this object. As far as it may
      consist of internal collections, a more diffusive knowledge of the
      circumstances of the State may be necessary. But will not this
      also be possessed in sufficient degree by a very few intelligent
      men, diffusively elected within the State? Divide the largest
      State into ten or twelve districts, and it will be found that
      there will be no peculiar local interests in either, which will
      not be within the knowledge of the representative of the district.
      Besides this source of information, the laws of the State, framed
      by representatives from every part of it, will be almost of
      themselves a sufficient guide. In every State there have been
      made, and must continue to be made, regulations on this subject
      which will, in many cases, leave little more to be done by the
      federal legislature, than to review the different laws, and reduce
      them in one general act. A skillful individual in his closet with
      all the local codes before him, might compile a law on some
      subjects of taxation for the whole union, without any aid from
      oral information, and it may be expected that whenever internal
      taxes may be necessary, and particularly in cases requiring
      uniformity throughout the States, the more simple objects will be
      preferred. To be fully sensible of the facility which will be
      given to this branch of federal legislation by the assistance of
      the State codes, we need only suppose for a moment that this or
      any other State were divided into a number of parts, each having
      and exercising within itself a power of local legislation. Is it
      not evident that a degree of local information and preparatory
      labor would be found in the several volumes of their proceedings,
      which would very much shorten the labors of the general
      legislature, and render a much smaller number of members
      sufficient for it? The federal councils will derive great
      advantage from another circumstance. The representatives of each
      State will not only bring with them a considerable knowledge of
      its laws, and a local knowledge of their respective districts, but
      will probably in all cases have been members, and may even at the
      very time be members, of the State legislature, where all the
      local information and interests of the State are assembled, and
      from whence they may easily be conveyed by a very few hands into
      the legislature of the United States. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p7">The observations made on the subject of taxation apply
      with greater force to the case of the militia. For however
      different the rules of discipline may be in different States, they
      are the same throughout each particular State; and depend on
      circumstances which can differ but little in different parts of
      the same State. <a class="permalink" href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p8">The attentive reader will discern that the reasoning
      here used, to prove the sufficiency of a moderate number of
      representatives, does not in any respect contradict what was urged
      on another occasion with regard to the extensive information which
      the representatives ought to possess, and the time that might be
      necessary for acquiring it. This information, so far as it may
      relate to local objects, is rendered necessary and difficult, not
      by a difference of laws and local circumstances within a single
      State, but of those among different States. Taking each State by
      itself, its laws are the same, and its interests but little
      diversified. A few men, therefore, will possess all the knowledge
      requisite for a proper representation of them. Were the interests
      and affairs of each individual State perfectly simple and uniform,
      a knowledge of them in one part would involve a knowledge of them
      in every other, and the whole State might be competently
      represented by a single member taken from any part of it. On a
      comparison of the different States together, we find a great
      dissimilarity in their laws, and in many other circumstances
      connected with the objects of federal legislation, with all of
      which the federal representatives ought to have some acquaintance.
      Whilst a few representatives, therefore, from each State, may
      bring with them a due knowledge of their own State, every
      representative will have much information to acquire concerning
      all the other States. The changes of time, as was formerly
      remarked, on the comparative situation of the different States,
      will have an assimilating effect. The effect of time on the
      internal affairs of the States, taken singly, will be just the
      contrary. At present some of the States are little more than a
      society of husbandmen. Few of them have made much progress in
      those branches of industry which give a variety and complexity to
      the affairs of a nation. These, however, will in all of them be
      the fruits of a more advanced population, and will require, on the
      part of each State, a fuller representation. The foresight of the
      convention has accordingly taken care that the progress of
      population may be accompanied with a proper increase of the
      representative branch of the government. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p8">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p9">The experience of Great Britain, which presents to
      mankind so many political lessons, both of the monitory and
      exemplary kind, and which has been frequently consulted in the
      course of these inquiries, corroborates the result of the
      reflections which we have just made. The number of inhabitants in
      the two kingdoms of England and Scotland cannot be stated at less
      than eight millions. The representatives of these eight millions
      in the House of Commons amount to five hundred and fifty-eight. Of
      this number, one ninth are elected by three hundred and sixty-four
      persons, and one half, by five thousand seven hundred and
      twenty-three persons.<a class="note" href="#note1">1</a> It cannot
      be supposed that the half thus elected, and who do not even reside
      among the people at large, can add any thing either to the
      security of the people against the government, or to the knowledge
      of their circumstances and interests in the legislative councils.
      On the contrary, it is notorious, that they are more frequently
      the representatives and instruments of the executive magistrate,
      than the guardians and advocates of the popular rights. They might
      therefore, with great propriety, be considered as something more
      than a mere deduction from the real representatives of the nation.
      We will, however, consider them in this light alone, and will not
      extend the deduction to a considerable number of others, who do
      not reside among their constitutents, are very faintly connected
      with them, and have very little particular knowledge of their
      affairs. With all these concessions, two hundred and seventy-nine
      persons only will be the depository of the safety, interest, and
      happiness of eight millions that is to say, there will be one
      representative only to maintain the rights and explain the
      situation <em>of twenty-eight thousand six hundred and
      seventy</em> constitutents, in an assembly exposed to the whole
      force of executive influence, and extending its authority to every
      object of legislation within a nation whose affairs are in the
      highest degree diversified and complicated. Yet it is very
      certain, not only that a valuable portion of freedom has been
      preserved under all these circumstances, but that the defects in
      the British code are chargeable, in a very small proportion, on
      the ignorance of the legislature concerning the circumstances of
      the people. Allowing to this case the weight which is due to it,
      and comparing it with that of the House of Representatives as
      above explained it seems to give the fullest assurance, that a
      representative for every <em>thirty thousand inhabitants</em> will
      render the latter both a safe and competent guardian of the
      interests which will be confided to it. <a class="permalink"
