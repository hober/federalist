    <h2 class="entry-summary"  >The Powers of the Judiciary</h2>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><span class="initial">To judge</span> with accuracy of
      the proper extent of the federal judicature, it will be necessary
      to consider, in the first place, what are its proper objects. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">It seems scarcely to admit of controversy, that the
      judicary authority of the Union ought to extend to these several
      descriptions of cases: 1<sup>st</sup>, to all those which arise out of the
      laws of the United States, passed in pursuance of their just and
      constitutional powers of legislation; 2<sup>d</sup>, to all those which
      concern the execution of the provisions expressly contained in the
      articles of Union; 3<sup>d</sup>, to all those in which the United States are
      a party; 4<sup>th</sup>, to all those which involve the <em>peace</em> of the
      <em>confederacy</em>, whether they relate to the intercourse
      between the United States and foreign nations, or to that between
      the States themselves; 5<sup>th</sup>, to all those which originate on the
      high seas, and are of admiralty or maritime jurisdiction; and,
      lastly, to all those in which the State tribunals cannot be
      supposed to be impartial and unbiased. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">The first point depends upon this obvious
      consideration, that there ought always to be a constitutional
      method of giving efficacy to constitutional provisions. What, for
      instance, would avail restrictions on the authority of the State
      legislatures, without some constitutional mode of enforcing the
      observance of them? The States, by the plan of the convention, are
      prohibited from doing a variety of things, some of which are
      incompatible with the interests of the Union, and others with the
      principles of good government. The imposition of duties on
      imported articles, and the emission of paper money, are specimens
      of each kind. No man of sense will believe, that such prohibitions
      would be scrupulously regarded, without some effectual power in
      the government to restrain or correct the infractions of them.
      This power must either be a direct negative on the State laws, or
      an authority in the federal courts to overrule such as might be in
      manifest contravention of the articles of Union. There is no third
      course that I can imagine. The latter appears to have been thought
      by the convention preferable to the former, and, I presume, will
      be most agreeable to the States. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">As to the second point, it is impossible, by any
      argument or comment, to make it clearer than it is in itself. If
      there are such things as political axioms, the propriety of the
      judicial power of a government being coextensive with its
      legislative, may be ranked among the number. The mere necessity of
      uniformity in the interpretation of the national laws, decides the
      question. Thirteen independent courts of final jurisdiction over
      the same causes, arising upon the same laws, is a hydra in
      government, from which nothing but contradiction and confusion can
      proceed. <a class="permalink" href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">Still less need be said in regard to the third point.
      Controversies between the nation and its members or citizens, can
      only be properly referred to the national tribunals. Any other
      plan would be contrary to reason, to precedent, and to decorum. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">The fourth point rests on this plain proposition, that
      the peace of the <em>whole</em> ought not to be left at the
      disposal of a <em>part</em>. The Union will undoubtedly be
      answerable to foreign powers for the conduct of its members. And
      the responsibility for an injury ought ever to be accompanied with
      the faculty of preventing it. As the denial or perversion of
      justice by the sentences of courts, as well as in any other
      manner, is with reason classed among the just causes of war, it
      will follow that the federal judiciary ought to have cognizance of
      all causes in which the citizens of other countries are concerned.
      This is not less essential to the preservation of the public
      faith, than to the security of the public tranquillity. A
      distinction may perhaps be imagined between cases arising upon
      treaties and the laws of nations and those which may stand merely
      on the footing of the municipal law. The former kind may be
      supposed proper for the federal jurisdiction, the latter for that
      of the States. But it is at least problematical, whether an unjust
      sentence against a foreigner, where the subject of controversy was
      wholly relative to the lex loci, would not, if unredressed, be an
      aggression upon his sovereign, as well as one which violated the
      stipulations of a treaty or the general law of nations. And a
      still greater objection to the distinction would result from the
      immense difficulty, if not impossibility, of a practical
      discrimination between the cases of one complexion and those of
      the other. So great a proportion of the cases in which foreigners
      are parties, involve national questions, that it is by far most
      safe and most expedient to refer all those in which they are
      concerned to the national tribunals. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p7">The power of determining causes between two States,
      between one State and the citizens of another, and between the
      citizens of different States, is perhaps not less essential to the
      peace of the Union than that which has been just examined. History
      gives us a horrid picture of the dissensions and private wars
      which distracted and desolated Germany prior to the institution of
      the Imperial Chamber by Maximilian, towards the close of the
      fifteenth century; and informs us, at the same time, of the vast
      influence of that institution in appeasing the disorders and
      establishing the tranquillity of the empire. This was a court
      invested with authority to decide finally all differences among
      the members of the Germanic body. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p8">A method of terminating territorial disputes between
      the States, under the authority of the federal head, was not
      unattended to, even in the imperfect system by which they have
      been hitherto held together. But there are many other sources,
      besides interfering claims of boundary, from which bickerings and
      animosities may spring up among the members of the Union. To some
      of these we have been witnesses in the course of our past
      experience. It will readily be conjectured that I allude to the
      fraudulent laws which have been passed in too many of the States.
      And though the proposed Constitution establishes particular guards
      against the repetition of those instances which have heretofore
      made their appearance, yet it is warrantable to apprehend that the
      spirit which produced them will assume new shapes, that could not
      be foreseen nor specifically provided against. Whatever practices
      may have a tendency to disturb the harmony between the States, are
      proper objects of federal superintendence and control. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p8">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p9">It may be esteemed the basis of the Union, that <q
      cite="constitution#a4s2">the citizens of each State shall be <a
      href="constitution#a4s2">entitled to all the privileges and
      immunities</a> of citizens of the several States.</q> And if it be
      a just principle that every government <em>ought to possess the
      means of executing its own provisions by its own authority</em>,
      it will follow, that in order to the inviolable maintenance of
      that equality of privileges and immunities to which the citizens
      of the Union will be entitled, the national judiciary ought to
      preside in all cases in which one State or its citizens are
      opposed to another State or its citizens. To secure the full
      effect of so fundamental a provision against all evasion and
      subterfuge, it is necessary that its construction should be
      committed to that tribunal which, having no local attachments,
      will be likely to be impartial between the different States and
      their citizens, and which, owing its official existence to the
      Union, will never be likely to feel any bias inauspicious to the
      principles on which it is founded. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p9">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p10">The fifth point will demand little animadversion. The
      most bigoted idolizers of State authority have not thus far shown
      a disposition to deny the national judiciary the cognizances of
      maritime causes. These so generally depend on the laws of nations,
      and so commonly affect the rights of foreigners, that they fall
      within the considerations which are relative to the public peace.
      The most important part of them are, by the present Confederation,
      submitted to federal jurisdiction. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p10">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p11">The reasonableness of the agency of the national
      courts in cases in which the State tribunals cannot be supposed to
      be impartial, speaks for itself. No man ought certainly to be a
      judge in his own cause, or in any cause in respect to which he has
      the least interest or bias. This principle has no inconsiderable
      weight in designating the federal courts as the proper tribunals
      for the determination of controversies between different States
      and their citizens. And it ought to have the same operation in
      regard to some cases between citizens of the same State. Claims to
      land under grants of different States, founded upon adverse
      pretensions of boundary, are of this description. The courts of
      neither of the granting States could be expected to be unbiased.
      The laws may have even prejudged the question, and tied the courts
      down to decisions in favor of the grants of the State to which
      they belonged. And even where this had not been done, it would be
      natural that the judges, as men, should feel a strong predilection
      to the claims of their own government. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p11">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p12">Having thus laid down and discussed the principles
      which ought to regulate the constitution of the federal judiciary,
      we will proceed to test, by these principles, <a
      href="constitution#a3s2">the particular powers</a> of which,
      according to the plan of the convention, it is to be composed. It
      is to comprehend <q cite="constitution#a3s2">all cases in law and
      equity arising under the Constitution, the laws of the United
      States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their
      authority; to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public
      ministers, and consuls; to all cases of admiralty and maritime
      jurisdiction; to controversies to which the United States shall be
      a party; to controversies between two or more States; between a
      State and citizens of another State; between citizens of different
      States; between citizens of the same State claiming lands and
      grants of different States; and between a State or the citizens
      thereof and foreign states, citizens, and subjects.</q> This
      constitutes the entire mass of the judicial authority of the
      Union. Let us now review it in detail. It is, then, to extend: <a
      class="permalink" href="#p12">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p13">First. To all cases in law and equity, <em>arising
      under the constitution</em> and <em>the laws of the united
      states</em>. This corresponds with the two first classes of
      causes, which have been enumerated, as proper for the jurisdiction
      of the United States. It has been asked, what is meant by <q
      cite="constitution#a3s2">cases arising under the Constitution,</q>
      in contradiction from those <q>arising under the laws of the
      United States</q>? The difference has been already explained. All
      the restrictions upon the authority of the State legislatures
      furnish examples of it. They are not, for instance, to emit paper
      money; but the interdiction results from the Constitution, and
      will have no connection with any law of the United States. Should
      paper money, notwithstanding, be emited, the controversies
      concerning it would be cases arising under the Constitution and
      not the laws of the United States, in the ordinary signification
      of the terms. This may serve as a sample of the whole. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p13">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p14">It has also been asked, what need of the word <q
      cite="constitution#a3s2">equity?</q> What equitable causes can
      grow out of the Constitution and laws of the United States? There
      is hardly a subject of litigation between individuals, which may
      not involve those ingredients of <em>fraud, accident, trust</em>,
      or <em>hardship</em>, which would render the matter an object of
      equitable rather than of legal jurisdiction, as the distinction is
      known and established in several of the States. It is the peculiar
      province, for instance, of a court of equity to relieve against
      what are called hard bargains: these are contracts in which,
      though there may have been no direct fraud or deceit, sufficient
      to invalidate them in a court of law, yet there may have been some
      undue and unconscionable advantage taken of the necessities or
      misfortunes of one of the parties, which a court of equity would
      not tolerate. In such cases, where foreigners were concerned on
      either side, it would be impossible for the federal judicatories
      to do justice without an equitable as well as a legal
      jurisdiction. Agreements to convey lands claimed under the grants
      of different States, may afford another example of the necessity
      of an equitable jurisdiction in the federal courts. This reasoning
      may not be so palpable in those States where the formal and
      technical distinction between <em>law</em> and <em>equity</em> is
      not maintained, as in this State, where it is exemplified by every
      day's practice. <a class="permalink" href="#p14">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p15">The judiciary authority of the Union is to extend: <a
      class="permalink" href="#p15">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p16">Second. To treaties made, or which shall be made,
      under the authority of the United States, and to all cases
      affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls. These
      belong to the fourth class of the enumerated cases, as they have
      an evident connection with the preservation of the national peace.
      <a class="permalink" href="#p16">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p17">Third. To cases of admiralty and maritime
      jurisdiction. These form, altogether, the fifth of the enumerated
      classes of causes proper for the cognizance of the national
      courts. <a class="permalink" href="#p17">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p18">Fourth. To controversies to which the United States
      shall be a party. These constitute the third of those classes. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p18">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p19">Fifth. To controversies between two or more States;
      between a State and citizens of another State; between citizens of
      different States. These belong to the fourth of those classes, and
      partake, in some measure, of the nature of the last. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p19">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p20">Sixth. To cases between the citizens of the same
      State, <em>claiming lands under grants of different states</em>.
      These fall within the last class, and <em>are the only instances
      in which the proposed constitution directly contemplates the
      cognizance of disputes between the citizens of the same
      state</em>. <a class="permalink" href="#p20">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p21">Seventh. To cases between a State and the citizens
      thereof, and foreign States, citizens, or subjects. These have
      been already explained to belong to the fourth of the enumerated
      classes, and have been shown to be, in a peculiar manner, the
      proper subjects of the national judicature. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p21">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p22">From this review of the particular powers of the
      federal judiciary, as marked out in the Constitution, it appears
      that they are all conformable to the principles which ought to
      have governed the structure of that department, and which were
      necessary to the perfection of the system. If some partial
      inconviences should appear to be connected with the incorporation
      of any of them into the plan, it ought to be recollected that the
      national legislature will have ample authority to make such
      <em>exceptions</em>, and to prescribe such regulations as will be
      calculated to obviate or remove these inconveniences. The
      possibility of particular mischiefs can never be viewed, by a
      wellinformed mind, as a solid objection to a general principle,
      which is calculated to avoid general mischiefs and to obtain
      general advantages. <a class="permalink" href="#p22">&#182;</a></p>
