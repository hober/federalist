      The Idea of Restraining the Legislative Authority in Regard to the
      Common Defense Considered
    </h3>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><span class="initial">It has</span> been urged, in
      different shapes, that a Constitution of the kind proposed by the
      convention cannot operate without the aid of a military force to
      execute its laws. This, however, like most other things that have
      been alleged on that side, rests on mere general assertion,
      unsupported by any precise or intelligible designation of the
      reasons upon which it is founded. As far as I have been able to
      divine the latent meaning of the objectors, it seems to originate
      in a presupposition that the people will be disinclined to the
      exercise of federal authority in any matter of an internal nature.
      Waiving any exception that might be taken to the inaccuracy or
      inexplicitness of the distinction between internal and external,
      let us inquire what ground there is to presuppose that
      disinclination in the people. Unless we presume at the same time
      that the powers of the general government will be worse
      administered than those of the State government, there seems to be
      no room for the presumption of ill-will, disaffection, or
      opposition in the people. I believe it may be laid down as a
      general rule that their confidence in and obedience to a
      government will commonly be proportioned to the goodness or
      badness of its administration. It must be admitted that there are
      exceptions to this rule; but these exceptions depend so entirely
      on accidental causes, that they cannot be considered as having any
      relation to the intrinsic merits or demerits of a constitution.
      These can only be judged of by general principles and maxims. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">Various reasons have been suggested, in the course of
      these papers, to induce a probability that the general government
      will be better administered than the particular governments; the
      principal of which reasons are that the extension of the spheres
      of election will present a greater option, or latitude of choice,
      to the people; that through the medium of the State legislatures
      which are select bodies of men, and which are to appoint the
      members of the national Senate there is reason to expect that this
      branch will generally be composed with peculiar care and judgment;
      that these circumstances promise greater knowledge and more
      extensive information in the national councils, and that they will
      be less apt to be tainted by the spirit of faction, and more out
      of the reach of those occasional ill-humors, or temporary
      prejudices and propensities, which, in smaller societies,
      frequently contaminate the public councils, beget injustice and
      oppression of a part of the community, and engender schemes which,
      though they gratify a momentary inclination or desire, terminate
      in general distress, dissatisfaction, and disgust. Several
      additional reasons of considerable force, to fortify that
      probability, will occur when we come to survey, with a more
      critical eye, the interior structure of the edifice which we are
      invited to erect. It will be sufficient here to remark, that until
      satisfactory reasons can be assigned to justify an opinion, that
      the federal government is likely to be administered in such a
      manner as to render it odious or contemptible to the people, there
      can be no reasonable foundation for the supposition that the laws
      of the Union will meet with any greater obstruction from them, or
      will stand in need of any other methods to enforce their
      execution, than the laws of the particular members. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">The hope of impunity is a strong incitement to
      sedition; the dread of punishment, a proportionably strong
      discouragement to it. Will not the government of the Union, which,
      if possessed of a due degree of power, can call to its aid the
      collective resources of the whole Confederacy, be more likely to
      repress the <em>former</em> sentiment and to inspire the
      <em>latter</em>, than that of a single State, which can only
      command the resources within itself? A turbulent faction in a
      State may easily suppose itself able to contend with the friends
      to the government in that State; but it can hardly be so
      infatuated as to imagine itself a match for the combined efforts
      of the Union. If this reflection be just, there is less danger of
      resistance from irregular combinations of individuals to the
      authority of the Confederacy than to that of a single member. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">I will, in this place, hazard an observation, which
      will not be the less just because to some it may appear new; which
      is, that the more the operations of the national authority are
      intermingled in the ordinary exercise of government, the more the
      citizens are accustomed to meet with it in the common occurrences
      of their political life, the more it is familiarized to their
      sight and to their feelings, the further it enters into those
      objects which touch the most sensible chords and put in motion the
      most active springs of the human heart, the greater will be the
      probability that it will conciliate the respect and attachment of
      the community. Man is very much a creature of habit. A thing that
      rarely strikes his senses will generally have but little influence
      upon his mind. A government continually at a distance and out of
      sight can hardly be expected to interest the sensations of the
      people. The inference is, that the authority of the Union, and the
      affections of the citizens towards it, will be strengthened,
      rather than weakened, by its extension to what are called matters
      of internal concern; and will have less occasion to recur to
      force, in proportion to the familiarity and comprehensiveness of
      its agency. The more it circulates through those channls and
      currents in which the passions of mankind naturally flow, the less
      will it require the aid of the violent and perilous expedients of
      compulsion. <a class="permalink" href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">One thing, at all events, must be evident, that a
      government like the one proposed would bid much fairer to avoid
      the necessity of using force, than that species of league contend
      for by most of its opponents; the authority of which should only
      operate upon the States in their political or collective
      capacities. It has been shown that in such a Confederacy there can
      be no sanction for the laws but force; that frequent delinquencies
      in the members are the natural offspring of the very frame of the
      government; and that as often as these happen, they can only be
      redressed, if at all, by war and violence. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">The plan reported by the convention, by extending the
      authority of the federal head to the individual citizens of the
      several States, will enable the government to employ the ordinary
      magistracy of each, in the execution of its laws. It is easy to
      perceive that this will tend to destroy, in the common
      apprehension, all distinction between the sources from which they
      might proceed; and will give the federal government the same
      advantage for securing a due obedience to its authority which is
      enjoyed by the government of each State, in addition to the
      influence on public opinion which will result from the important
      consideration of its having power to call to its assistance and
      support the resources of the whole Union. It merits particular
      attention in this place, that the laws of the Confederacy, as to
      the <em>enumerated</em> and <em>legitimate</em> objects of its
      jurisdiction, will become the <em>supreme law</em> of the land; to
      the observance of which all officers, legislative, executive, and
      judicial, in each State, will be bound by the sanctity of an oath.
      Thus the legislatures, courts, and magistrates, of the respective
      members, will be incorporated into the operations of the national
      government <em>as far as its just and constitutional authority
      extends</em>; and will be rendered auxiliary to the enforcement of
      its laws.<a class="note" href="#note1">1</a> Any man who will
      pursue, by his own reflections, the consequences of this
      situation, will perceive that there is good ground to calculate
      upon a regular and peaceable execution of the laws of the Union,
      if its powers are administered with a common share of prudence. If
      we will arbitrarily suppose the contrary, we may deduce any
      inferences we please from the supposition; for it is certainly
      possible, by an injudicious exercise of the authorities of the
      best government that ever was, or ever can be instituted, to
      provoke and precipitate the people into the wildest excesses. But
      though the adversaries of the proposed Constitution should presume
      that the national rulers would be insensible to the motives of
      public good, or to the obligations of duty, I would still ask them
      how the interests of ambition, or the views of encroachment, can
      be promoted by such a conduct? <a class="permalink"
