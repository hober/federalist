      The Powers Necessary to the Common Defense Further Considered
    </h3>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><span class="initial">It may</span> perhaps be urged
      that the objects enumerated in the preceding number ought to be
      provided for by the State governments, under the direction of the
      Union. But this would be, in reality, an inversion of the primary
      principle of our political association, as it would in practice
      transfer the care of the common defense from the federal head to
      the individual members: a project oppressive to some States,
      dangerous to all, and baneful to the Confederacy. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">The territories of Britain, Spain, and of the Indian
      nations in our neighborhood do not border on particular States,
      but encircle the Union from Maine to Georgia. The danger, though
      in different degrees, is therefore common. And the means of
      guarding against it ought, in like manner, to be the objects of
      common councils and of a common treasury. It happens that some
      States, from local situation, are more directly exposed. New York
      is of this class. Upon the plan of separate provisions, New York
      would have to sustain the whole weight of the establishments
      requisite to her immediate safety, and to the mediate or ultimate
      protection of her neighbors. This would neither be equitable as it
      respected New York nor safe as it respected the other States.
      Various inconveniences would attend such a system. The States, to
      whose lot it might fall to support the necessary establishments,
      would be as little able as willing, for a considerable time to
      come, to bear the burden of competent provisions. The security of
      all would thus be subjected to the parsimony, improvidence, or
      inability of a part. If the resources of such part becoming more
      abundant and extensive, its provisions should be proportionally
      enlarged, the other States would quickly take the alarm at seeing
      the whole military force of the Union in the hands of two or three
      of its members, and those probably amongst the most powerful. They
      would each choose to have some counterpoise, and pretenses could
      easily be contrived. In this situation, military establishments,
      nourished by mutual jealousy, would be apt to swell beyond their
      natural or proper size; and being at the separate disposal of the
      members, they would be engines for the abridgment or demolition of
      the national authcrity. <a class="permalink" href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">Reasons have been already given to induce a supposition
      that the State governments will too naturally be prone to a
      rivalship with that of the Union, the foundation of which will be
      the love of power; and that in any contest between the federal
      head and one of its members the people will be most apt to unite
      with their local government. If, in addition to this immense
      advantage, the ambition of the members should be stimulated by the
      separate and independent possession of military forces, it would
      afford too strong a temptation and too great a facility to them to
      make enterprises upon, and finally to subvert, the constitutional
      authority of the Union. On the other hand, the liberty of the
      people would be less safe in this state of things than in that
      which left the national forces in the hands of the national
      government. As far as an army may be considered as a dangerous
      weapon of power, it had better be in those hands of which the
      people are most likely to be jealous than in those of which they
      are least likely to be jealous. For it is a truth, which the
      experience of ages has attested, that the people are always most
      in danger when the means of injuring their rights are in the
      possession of those of whom they entertain the least suspicion. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">The framers of the existing Confederation, fully aware
      of the danger to the Union from the separate possession of
      military forces by the States, have, in express terms, <a
      href="articles#a6c4">prohibited them from having either ships or
      troops</a>, unless with the consent of Congress. The truth is,
      that the existence of a federal government and military
      establishments under State authority are not less at variance with
      each other than a due supply of the federal treasury and <a
      href="articles#a9c5">the system of quotas and requisitions</a>. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">There are other lights besides those already taken
      notice of, in which the impropriety of restraints on the
      discretion of the national legislature will be equally manifest.
      The design of the objection, which has been mentioned, is to
      preclude standing armies in time of peace, though we have never
      been informed how far it is designed the prohibition should
      extend; whether to raising armies as well as to <em>keeping them
      up</em> in a season of tranquillity or not. If it be confined to
      the latter it will have no precise signification, and it will be
      ineffectual for the purpose intended. When armies are once raised
      what shall be denominated <q>keeping them up,</q> contrary to the
      sense of the Constitution? What time shall be requisite to
      ascertain the violation? Shall it be a week, a month, a year? Or
      shall we say they may be continued as long as the danger which
      occasioned their being raised continues? This would be to admit
      that they might be kept up <em>in time of peace</em>, against
      threatening or impending danger, which would be at once to deviate
      from the literal meaning of the prohibition, and to introduce an
      extensive latitude of construction. Who shall judge of the
      continuance of the danger? This must undoubtedly be submitted to
      the national government, and the matter would then be brought to
      this issue, that the national government, to provide against
      apprehended danger, might in the first instance raise troops, and
      might afterwards keep them on foot as long as they supposed the
      peace or safety of the community was in any degree of jeopardy. It
      is easy to perceive that a discretion so latitudinary as this
      would afford ample room for eluding the force of the provision.
      The supposed utility of a provision of this kind can only be
      founded on the supposed probability, or at least possibility, of a
      combination between the executive and the legislative, in some
      scheme of usurpation. Should this at any time happen, how easy
      would it be to fabricate pretenses of approaching danger! Indian
      hostilities, instigated by Spain or Britain, would always be at
      hand. Provocations to produce the desired appearances might even
      be given to some foreign power, and appeased again by timely
      concessions. If we can reasonably presume such a combination to
      have been formed, and that the enterprise is warranted by a
      sufficient prospect of success, the army, when once raised, from
      whatever cause, or on whatever pretext, may be applied to the
      execution of the project. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">If, to obviate this consequence, it should be resolved
      to extend the prohibition to the <em>raising</em> of armies in
      time of peace, the United States would then exhibit the most
      extraordinary spectacle which the world has yet seen, that of a
      nation incapacitated by its Constitution to prepare for defense,
      before it was actually invaded. As the ceremony of a formal
      denunciation of war has of late fallen into disuse, the presence
      of an enemy within our territories must be waited for, as the
      legal warrant to the government to begin its levies of men for the
      protection of the State. We must receive the blow, before we could
      even prepare to return it. All that kind of policy by which
      nations anticipate distant danger, and meet the gathering storm,
      must be abstained from, as contrary to the genuine maxims of a
      free government. We must expose our property and liberty to the
      mercy of foreign invaders, and invite them by our weakness to
      seize the naked and defenseless prey, because we are afraid that
      rulers, created by our choice, dependent on our will, might
      endanger that liberty, by an abuse of the means necessary to its
      preservation. <a class="permalink" href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p7">Here I expect we shall be told that the militia of the
      country is its natural bulwark, and would be at all times equal to
      the national defense. This doctrine, in substance, had like to
      have lost us our independence. It cost millions to the United
      States that might have been saved. The facts which, from our own
      experience, forbid a reliance of this kind, are too recent to
      permit us to be the dupes of such a suggestion. The steady
      operations of war against a regular and disciplined army can only
      be successfully conducted by a force of the same kind.
      Considerations of economy, not less than of stability and vigor,
      confirm this position. The American militia, in the course of the
      late war, have, by their valor on numerous occasions, erected
      eternal monuments to their fame; but the bravest of them feel and
      know that the liberty of their country could not have been
      established by their efforts alone, however great and valuable
      they were. War, like most other things, is a science to be
      acquired and perfected by diligence, by perserverance, by time,
      and by practice. <a class="permalink" href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p8">All violent policy, as it is contrary to the natural
      and experienced course of human affairs, defeats itself.
      Pennsylvania, at this instant, affords an example of the truth of
      this remark. The Bill of Rights of that State declares that
      standing armies are dangerous to liberty, and ought not to be kept
      up in time of peace. Pennsylvania, nevertheless, in a time of
      profound peace, from the existence of partial disorders in one or
      two of her counties, has resolved to raise a body of troops; and
      in all probability will keep them up as long as there is any
      appearance of danger to the public peace. The conduct of
      Massachusetts affords a lesson on the same subject, though on
      different ground. That State (without waiting for the sanction of
      Congress, <a href="articles#a6c4">as the articles of the
      Confederation require</a>) was compelled to raise troops to quell
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shays'_Rebellion">a domestic
      insurrection</a>, and still keeps a corps in pay to prevent a
      revival of the spirit of revolt. The particular constitution of
      Massachusetts opposed no obstacle to the measure; but the instance
      is still of use to instruct us that cases are likely to occur
      under our government, as well as under those of other nations,
      which will sometimes render a military force in time of peace
      essential to the security of the society, and that it is therefore
      improper in this respect to control the legislative discretion. It
      also teaches us, in its application to the United States, how
      little the rights of a feeble government are likely to be
      respected, even by its own constituents. And it teaches us, in
      addition to the rest, how unequal parchment provisions are to a
      struggle with public necessity. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p8">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p9">It was a fundamental maxim of the <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta">Lacedaemonian
      commonwealth</a>, that the post of admiral should not be conferred
      twice on the same person. The Peloponnesian confederates, having
      suffered a severe defeat at sea from the Athenians, demanded <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysander">Lysander</a>, who had
      before served with success in that capacity, to command the
      combined fleets. The Lacedaemonians, to gratify their allies, and
      yet preserve the semblance of an adherence to their ancient
      institutions, had recourse to the flimsy subterfuge of investing
      Lysander with the real power of admiral, under the nominal title
      of vice-admiral. This instance is selected from among a multitude
      that might be cited to confirm the truth already advanced and
      illustrated by domestic examples; which is, that nations pay
      little regard to rules and maxims calculated in their very nature
      to run counter to the necessities of society. Wise politicians
      will be cautious about fettering the government with restrictions
      that cannot be observed, because they know that every breach of
      the fundamental laws, though dictated by necessity, impairs that
      sacred reverence which ought to be maintained in the breast of
      rulers towards the constitution of a country, and forms a
      precedent for other breaches where the same plea of necessity does
      not exist at all, or is less urgent and palpable. <a
