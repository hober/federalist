      The Powers Conferred by the Constitution Further Considered
    </h2>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><span class="initial">The second</span> class of
      powers, lodged in the general government, consists of those which
      regulate the intercourse with foreign nations, to wit: to <a
      href="constitution#a2s2c2">make treaties</a>; to <a
      href="constitution#a2s2c2">send and receive ambassadors, other
      public ministers, and consuls</a>; to <a
      href="constitution#a1s8c10">define and punish piracies and
      felonies committed on the high seas, and offenses against the law
      of nations</a>; to <a href="constitution#a1s8c3">regulate foreign
      commerce</a>, including a <a href="constitution#a1s9c1">power to
      prohibit, after the year 1808, the importation of slaves</a>, and
      to <a href="constitution#a1s9c1">lay an intermediate duty</a> of
      ten dollars per head, as a discouragement to such importations. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">This class of powers forms an obvious and essential
      branch of the federal administration. If we are to be one nation
      in any respect, it clearly ought to be in respect to other
      nations. <a class="permalink" href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">The powers to make treaties and to send and receive
      ambassadors, speak their own propriety. Both of them are comprised
      in the articles of Confederation, with this difference only, that
      the former is disembarrassed, by the plan of the convention, of an
      exception, under which treaties might be substantially frustrated
      by regulations of the States; and that a power of appointing and
      receiving <q cite="constitution#a2s2c2">other public ministers and
      consuls,</q> is expressly and very properly added to the former
      provision concerning ambassadors. The term ambassador, if taken
      strictly, as seems to be required by <a href="articles#a2">the
      second of the articles of Confederation</a>, comprehends the
      highest grade only of public ministers, and excludes the grades
      which the United States will be most likely to prefer, where
      foreign embassies may be necessary. And under no latitude of
      construction will the term comprehend consuls. Yet it has been
      found expedient, and has been the practice of Congress, to employ
      the inferior grades of public ministers, and to send and receive
      consuls. It is true, that where treaties of commerce stipulate for
      the mutual appointment of consuls, whose functions are connected
      with commerce, the admission of foreign consuls may fall within
      the power of making commercial treaties; and that where no such
      treaties exist, the mission of American consuls into foreign
      countries may <em>perhaps</em> be covered under the authority,
      given by <a href="articles#a9">the ninth article of the
      Confederation</a>, to appoint all such civil officers as may be
      necessary for managing the general affairs of the United States.
      But the admission of consuls into the United States, where no
      previous treaty has stipulated it, seems to have been nowhere
      provided for. A supply of the omission is one of the lesser
      instances in which the convention have improved on the model
      before them. But the most minute provisions become important when
      they tend to obviate the necessity or the pretext for gradual and
      unobserved usurpations of power. A list of the cases in which
      Congress have been betrayed, or forced by the defects of the
      Confederation, into violations of their chartered authorities,
      would not a little surprise those who have paid no attention to
      the subject; and would be no inconsiderable argument in favor of
      the new Constitution, which seems to have provided no less
      studiously for the lesser, than the more obvious and striking
      defects of the old. <a class="permalink" href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">The power to define and punish piracies and felonies
      committed on the high seas, and offenses against the law of
      nations, belongs with equal propriety to the general government,
      and is a still greater improvement on the articles of
      Confederation. These articles contain no provision for the case of
      offenses against the law of nations; and consequently leave it in
      the power of any indiscreet member to embroil the Confederacy with
      foreign nations. The provision of the federal articles on the
      subject of piracies and felonies extends no further than to <a
      href="articles#a9">the establishment of courts for the trial of
      these offenses</a>. The definition of piracies might, perhaps,
      without inconveniency, be left to the law of nations; though a
      legislative definition of them is found in most municipal codes. A
      definition of felonies on the high seas is evidently requisite.
      Felony is a term of loose signification, even in the common law of
      England; and of various import in the statute law of that kingdom.
      But neither the common nor the statute law of that, or of any
      other nation, ought to be a standard for the proceedings of this,
      unless previously made its own by legislative adoption. The
      meaning of the term, as defined in the codes of the several
      States, would be as impracticable as the former would be a
      dishonorable and illegitimate guide. It is not precisely the same
      in any two of the States; and varies in each with every revision
      of its criminal laws. For the sake of certainty and uniformity,
      therefore, the power of defining felonies in this case was in
      every respect necessary and proper. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">The regulation of foreign commerce, having fallen
      within several views which have been taken of this subject, has
      been too fully discussed to need additional proofs here of its
      being properly submitted to the federal administration. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">It were doubtless to be wished, that the power of
      prohibiting the importation of slaves had not been postponed until
      the year 1808, or rather that it had been suffered to have
      immediate operation. But it is not difficult to account, either
      for this restriction on the general government, or for the manner
      in which the whole clause is expressed. It ought to be considered
      as a great point gained in favor of humanity, that a period of
      twenty years may terminate forever, within these States, a traffic
      which has so long and so loudly upbraided the barbarism of modern
      policy; that within that period, it will receive a considerable
      discouragement from the federal government, and may be totally
      abolished, by a concurrence of the few States which continue the
      unnatural traffic, in the prohibitory example which has been given
      by so great a majority of the Union. Happy would it be for the
      unfortunate Africans, if an equal prospect lay before them of
      being redeemed from the oppressions of their European brethren!
      Attempts have been made to pervert this clause into an objection
      against the Constitution, by representing it on one side as a
      criminal toleration of an illicit practice, and on another as
      calculated to prevent voluntary and beneficial emigrations from
      Europe to America. I mention these misconstructions, not with a
      view to give them an answer, for they deserve none, but as
      specimens of the manner and spirit in which some have thought fit
      to conduct their opposition to the proposed government. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p7">The powers included in the <em>third</em> class are
      those which provide for the harmony and proper intercourse among
      the States. <a class="permalink" href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p8">Under this head might be included the particular
      restraints imposed on the authority of the States, and certain
      powers of the judicial department; but the former are reserved for
      a distinct class, and the latter will be particularly examined
      when we arrive at the structure and organization of the
      government. I shall confine myself to a cursory review of the
      remaining powers comprehended under this third description, to
      wit: to <a href="constitution#a1s8c3">regulate commerce among the
      several States and the Indian tribes</a>; to <a
      href="constitution#a1s8c5">coin money</a>, regulate the value
      thereof, and of foreign coin; to <a
      href="constitution#a1s8c6">provide for the punishment of
      counterfeiting</a> the current coin and secureties of the United
      States; to <a href="constitution#a1s8c5">fix the standard of
      weights and measures</a>; to <a
      href="constitution#a1s8c4">establish a uniform rule of
      naturalization, and uniform laws of bankruptcy</a>, to <a
      href="constitution#a4s1">prescribe the manner</a> in which the
      public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of each State shall
      be proved, and the effect they shall have in other States; and to
      <a href="constitution#a1s8c7">establish post offices and post
      roads</a>. <a class="permalink" href="#p8">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p9">The defect of power in the existing Confederacy to
      regulate the commerce between its several members, is in the
      number of those which have been clearly pointed out by experience.
      To the proofs and remarks which former papers have brought into
      view on this subject, it may be added that without this
      supplemental provision, the great and essential power of
      regulating foreign commerce would have been incomplete and
      ineffectual. A very material object of this power was the relief
      of the States which import and export through other States, from
      the improper contributions levied on them by the latter. Were
      these at liberty to regulate the trade between State and State, it
      must be foreseen that ways would be found out to load the articles
      of import and export, during the passage through their
      jurisdiction, with duties which would fall on the makers of the
      latter and the consumers of the former. We may be assured by past
      experience, that such a practice would be introduced by future
      contrivances; and both by that and a common knowledge of human
      affairs, that it would nourish unceasing animosities, and not
      improbably terminate in serious interruptions of the public
      tranquillity. To those who do not view the question through the
      medium of passion or of interest, the desire of the commercial
      States to collect, in any form, an indirect revenue from their
      uncommercial neighbors, must appear not less impolitic than it is
      unfair; since it would stimulate the injured party, by resentment
      as well as interest, to resort to less convenient channels for
      their foreign trade. But the mild voice of reason, pleading the
      cause of an enlarged and permanent interest, is but too often
      drowned, before public bodies as well as individuals, by the
      clamors of an impatient avidity for immediate and immoderate gain.
      <a class="permalink" href="#p9">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p10">The necessity of a superintending authority over the
      reciprocal trade of confederated States, has been illustrated by
      other examples as well as our own. In Switzerland, where the Union
      is so very slight, each canton is obliged to allow to merchandises
      a passage through its jurisdiction into other cantons, without an
      augmentation of the tolls. In Germany it is a law of the empire,
      that the princes and states shall not lay tolls or customs on
      bridges, rivers, or passages, without the consent of the emperor
      and the diet; though it appears from a quotation in an antecedent
      paper, that the practice in this, as in many other instances in
      that confederacy, has not followed the law, and has produced there
      the mischiefs which have been foreseen here. Among the restraints
      imposed by the Union of the Netherlands on its members, one is,
      that they shall not establish imposts disadvantageous to their
      neighbors, without the general permission. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p10">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p11">The regulation of commerce with the Indian tribes is
      very properly unfettered from two limitations in the articles of
      Confederation, which render the provision obscure and
      contradictory. The power is there <a
      href="articles#a9c4">restrained to Indians, not members of any of
      the States, and is not to violate or infringe the legislative
      right of any State within its own limits</a>. What description of
      Indians are to be deemed members of a State, is not yet settled,
      and has been a question of frequent perplexity and contention in
      the federal councils. And how the trade with Indians, though not
      members of a State, yet residing within its legislative
      jurisdiction, can be regulated by an external authority, without
      so far intruding on the internal rights of legislation, is
      absolutely incomprehensible. This is not the only case in which
      the articles of Confederation have inconsiderately endeavored to
      accomplish impossibilities; to reconcile a partial sovereignty in
      the Union, with complete sovereignty in the States; to subvert a
      mathematical axiom, by taking away a part, and letting the whole
      remain. <a class="permalink" href="#p11">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p12">All that need be remarked on the power to coin money,
      regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin, is, that by
      providing for this last case, the Constitution has supplied a
      material omission in the articles of Confederation. The authority
      of the existing Congress is restrained to the regulation of coin
      <em>struck</em> by their own authority, or that of the respective
      States. It must be seen at once that the proposed uniformity in
      the <em>value</em> of the current coin might be destroyed by
      subjecting that of foreign coin to the different regulations of
      the different States. <a class="permalink" href="#p12">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p13">The punishment of counterfeiting the public
      securities, as well as the current coin, is submitted of course to
      that authority which is to secure the value of both. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p13">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p14">The regulation of weights and measures is <a
      href="articles#a9c4">transferred from the articles of
      Confederation</a>, and is founded on like considerations with the
      preceding power of regulating coin. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p14">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p15">The dissimilarity in the rules of naturalization has
      long been remarked as a fault in our system, and as laying a
      foundation for intricate and delicate questions. In <a
      href="articles#a4">the fourth article of the Confederation</a>, it
      is declared <q cite="articles#a4">that the <em>free
      inhabitants</em> of each of these States, paupers, vagabonds, and
      fugitives from justice, excepted, shall be entitled to all
      privileges and immunities of <em>free citizens</em> in the several
      States; and <em>the people</em> of each State shall, in every
      other, enjoy all the privileges of trade and commerce,</q> etc.
      There is a confusion of language here, which is remarkable. Why
      the terms <em>free inhabitants</em> are used in one part of the
      article, <em>free citizens</em> in another, and <em>people</em> in
      another; or what was meant by superadding to <q
      cite="articles#a4">all privileges and immunities of free
      citizens,</q> <q cite="articles#a4">all the privileges of trade
      and commerce,</q> cannot easily be determined. It seems to be a
      construction scarcely avoidable, however, that those who come
      under the denomination of <em>free inhabitants</em> of a State,
      although not citizens of such State, are entitled, in every other
      State, to all the privileges of <em>free citizens</em> of the
      latter; that is, to greater privileges than they may be entitled
      to in their own State: so that it may be in the power of a
      particular State, or rather every State is laid under a necessity,
      not only to confer the rights of citizenship in other States upon
      any whom it may admit to such rights within itself, but upon any
      whom it may allow to become inhabitants within its jurisdiction.
      But were an exposition of the term &quot;inhabitants&quot; to be
      admitted which would confine the stipulated privileges to citizens
      alone, the difficulty is diminished only, not removed. The very
      improper power would still be retained by each State, of
      naturalizing aliens in every other State. In one State, residence
      for a short term confirms all the rights of citizenship: in
      another, qualifications of greater importance are required. An
      alien, therefore, legally incapacitated for certain rights in the
      latter, may, by previous residence only in the former, elude his
      incapacity; and thus the law of one State be preposterously
      rendered paramount to the law of another, within the jurisdiction
      of the other. We owe it to mere casualty, that very serious
      embarrassments on this subject have been hitherto escaped. By the
      laws of several States, certain descriptions of aliens, who had
      rendered themselves obnoxious, were laid under interdicts
      inconsistent not only with the rights of citizenship but with the
      privilege of residence. What would have been the consequence, if
      such persons, by residence or otherwise, had acquired the
      character of citizens under the laws of another State, and then
      asserted their rights as such, both to residence and citizenship,
      within the State proscribing them? Whatever the legal consequences
      might have been, other consequences would probably have resulted,
      of too serious a nature not to be provided against. The new
      Constitution has accordingly, with great propriety, made provision
      against them, and all others proceeding from the defect of the
      Confederation on this head, by authorizing the general government
      to establish a uniform rule of naturalization throughout the
      United States. <a class="permalink" href="#p15">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p16">The power of establishing uniform laws of bankruptcy
      is so intimately connected with the regulation of commerce, and
      will prevent so many frauds where the parties or their property
      may lie or be removed into different States, that the expediency
      of it seems not likely to be drawn into question. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p16">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p17">The power of prescribing by general laws, the manner
      in which the public acts, records and judicial proceedings of each
      State shall be proved, and the effect they shall have in other
      States, is an evident and valuable improvement on <a
      href="articles#a4c3">the clause relating to this subject in the
      articles of Confederation</a>. The meaning of the latter is
      extremely indeterminate, and can be of little importance under any
      interpretation which it will bear. The power here established may
      be rendered a very convenient instrument of justice, and be
      particularly beneficial on the borders of contiguous States, where
      the effects liable to justice may be suddenly and secretly
      translated, in any stage of the process, within a foreign
      jurisdiction. <a class="permalink" href="#p17">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p18">The power of establishing post roads must, in every
      view, be a harmless power, and may, perhaps, by judicious
      management, become productive of great public conveniency. Nothing
      which tends to facilitate the intercourse between the States can
      be deemed unworthy of the public care. <a class="permalink"
