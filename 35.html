      Concerning the General Power of Taxation
    </h3>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><span class="initial">Before</span> we proceed to
      examine any other objections to an indefinite power of taxation in
      the Union, I shall make one general remark; which is, that if the
      jurisdiction of the national government, in the article of
      revenue, should be restricted to particular objects, it would
      naturally occasion an undue proportion of the public burdens to
      fall upon those objects. Two evils would spring from this source:
      the oppression of particular branches of industry; and an unequal
      distribution of the taxes, as well among the several States as
      among the citizens of the same State. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">Suppose, as has been contended for, the federal power
      of taxation were to be confined to duties on imports, it is
      evident that the government, for want of being able to command
      other resources, would frequently be tempted to extend these
      duties to an injurious excess. There are persons who imagine that
      they can never be carried to too great a length; since the higher
      they are, the more it is alleged they will tend to discourage an
      extravagant consumption, to produce a favorable balance of trade,
      and to promote domestic manufactures. But all extremes are
      pernicious in various ways. Exorbitant duties on imported articles
      would beget a general spirit of smuggling; which is always
      prejudicial to the fair trader, and eventually to the revenue
      itself: they tend to render other classes of the community
      tributary, in an improper degree, to the manufacturing classes, to
      whom they give a premature monopoly of the markets; they sometimes
      force industry out of its more natural channels into others in
      which it flows with less advantage; and in the last place, they
      oppress the merchant, who is often obliged to pay them himself
      without any retribution from the consumer. When the demand is
      equal to the quantity of goods at market, the consumer generally
      pays the duty; but when the markets happen to be overstocked, a
      great proportion falls upon the merchant, and sometimes not only
      exhausts his profits, but breaks in upon his capital. I am apt to
      think that a division of the duty, between the seller and the
      buyer, more often happens than is commonly imagined. It is not
      always possible to raise the price of a commodity in exact
      proportion to every additional imposition laid upon it. The
      merchant, especially in a country of small commercial capital, is
      often under a necessity of keeping prices down in order to a more
      expeditious sale. <a class="permalink" href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">The maxim that the consumer is the payer, is so much
      oftener true than the reverse of the proposition, that it is far
      more equitable that the duties on imports should go into a common
      stock, than that they should redound to the exclusive benefit of
      the importing States. But it is not so generally true as to render
      it equitable, that those duties should form the only national
      fund. When they are paid by the merchant they operate as an
      additional tax upon the importing State, whose citizens pay their
      proportion of them in the character of consumers. In this view
      they are productive of inequality among the States; which
      inequality would be increased with the increased extent of the
      duties. The confinement of the national revenues to this species
      of imposts would be attended with inequality, from a different
      cause, between the manufacturing and the non-manufacturing States.
      The States which can go farthest towards the supply of their own
      wants, by their own manufactures, will not, according to their
      numbers or wealth, consume so great a proportion of imported
      articles as those States which are not in the same favorable
      situation. They would not, therefore, in this mode alone
      contribute to the public treasury in a ratio to their abilities.
      To make them do this it is necessary that recourse be had to
      excises, the proper objects of which are particular kinds of
      manufactures. New York is more deeply interested in these
      considerations than such of her citizens as contend for limiting
      the power of the Union to external taxation may be aware of. New
      York is an importing State, and is not likely speedily to be, to
      any great extent, a manufacturing State. She would, of course,
      suffer in a double light from restraining the jurisdiction of the
      Union to commercial imposts. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">So far as these observations tend to inculcate a danger
      of the import duties being extended to an injurious extreme it may
      be observed, conformably to a remark made in another part of these
      papers, that the interest of the revenue itself would be a
      sufficient guard against such an extreme. I readily admit that
      this would be the case, as long as other resources were open; but
      if the avenues to them were closed, <em>hope</em>, stimulated by
      necessity, would beget experiments, fortified by rigorous
      precautions and additional penalties, which, for a time, would
      have the intended effect, till there had been leisure to contrive
      expedients to elude these new precautions. The first success would
      be apt to inspire false opinions, which it might require a long
      course of subsequent experience to correct. Necessity, especially
      in politics, often occasions false hopes, false reasonings, and a
      system of measures correspondingly erroneous. But even if this
      supposed excess should not be a consequence of the limitation of
      the federal power of taxation, the inequalities spoken of would
      still ensue, though not in the same degree, from the other causes
      that have been noticed. Let us now return to the examination of
      objections. <a class="permalink" href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">One which, if we may judge from the frequency of its
      repetition, seems most to be relied on, is, that the House of
      Representatives is not sufficiently numerous for the reception of
      all the different classes of citizens, in order to combine the
      interests and feelings of every part of the community, and to
      produce a due sympathy between the representative body and its
      constituents. This argument presents itself under a very specious
      and seducing form; and is well calculated to lay hold of the
      prejudices of those to whom it is addressed. But when we come to
      dissect it with attention, it will appear to be made up of nothing
      but fair-sounding words. The object it seems to aim at is, in the
      first place, impracticable, and in the sense in which it is
      contended for, is unnecessary. I reserve for another place the
      discussion of the question which relates to the sufficiency of the
      representative body in respect to numbers, and shall content
      myself with examining here the particular use which has been made
      of a contrary supposition, in reference to the immediate subject
      of our inquiries. <a class="permalink" href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">The idea of an actual representation of all classes of
      the people, by persons of each class, is altogether visionary.
      Unless it were expressly provided in the Constitution, that each
      different occupation should send one or more members, the thing
      would never take place in practice. Mechanics and manufacturers
      will always be inclined, with few exceptions, to give their votes
      to merchants, in preference to persons of their own professions or
      trades. Those discerning citizens are well aware that the mechanic
      and manufacturing arts furnish the materials of mercantile
      enterprise and industry. Many of them, indeed, are immediately
      connected with the operations of commerce. They know that the
      merchant is their natural patron and friend; and they are aware,
      that however great the confidence they may justly feel in their
      own good sense, their interests can be more effectually promoted
      by the merchant than by themselves. They are sensible that their
      habits in life have not been such as to give them those acquired
      endowments, without which, in a deliberative assembly, the
      greatest natural abilities are for the most part useless; and that
      the influence and weight, and superior acquirements of the
      merchants render them more equal to a contest with any spirit
      which might happen to infuse itself into the public councils,
      unfriendly to the manufacturing and trading interests. These
      considerations, and many others that might be mentioned prove, and
      experience confirms it, that artisans and manufacturers will
      commonly be disposed to bestow their votes upon merchants and
      those whom they recommend. We must therefore consider merchants as
      the natural representatives of all these classes of the community.
      <a class="permalink" href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p7">With regard to the learned professions, little need be
      observed; they truly form no distinct interest in society, and
      according to their situation and talents, will be indiscriminately
      the objects of the confidence and choice of each other, and of
      other parts of the community. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p8">Nothing remains but the landed interest; and this, in a
      political view, and particularly in relation to taxes, I take to
      be perfectly united, from the wealthiest landlord down to the
      poorest tenant. No tax can be laid on land which will not affect
      the proprietor of millions of acres as well as the proprietor of a
      single acre. Every landholder will therefore have a common
      interest to keep the taxes on land as low as possible; and common
      interest may always be reckoned upon as the surest bond of
      sympathy. But if we even could suppose a distinction of interest
      between the opulent landholder and the middling farmer, what
      reason is there to conclude, that the first would stand a better
      chance of being deputed to the national legislature than the last?
      If we take fact as our guide, and look into our own senate and
      assembly, we shall find that moderate proprietors of land prevail
      in both; nor is this less the case in the senate, which consists
      of a smaller number, than in the assembly, which is composed of a
      greater number. Where the qualifications of the electors are the
      same, whether they have to choose a small or a large number, their
      votes will fall upon those in whom they have most confidence;
      whether these happen to be men of large fortunes, or of moderate
      property, or of no property at all. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p8">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p9">It is said to be necessary, that all classes of
      citizens should have some of their own number in the
      representative body, in order that their feelings and interests
      may be the better understood and attended to. But we have seen
      that this will never happen under any arrangement that leaves the
      votes of the people free. Where this is the case, the
      representative body, with too few exceptions to have any influence
      on the spirit of the government, will be composed of landholders,
      merchants, and men of the learned professions. But where is the
      danger that the interests and feelings of the different classes of
      citizens will not be understood or attended to by these three
      descriptions of men? Will not the landholder know and feel
      whatever will promote or insure the interest of landed property?
      And will he not, from his own interest in that species of
      property, be sufficiently prone to resist every attempt to
      prejudice or encumber it? Will not the merchant understand and be
      disposed to cultivate, as far as may be proper, the interests of
      the mechanic and manufacturing arts, to which his commerce is so
      nearly allied? Will not the man of the learned profession, who
      will feel a neutrality to the rivalships between the different
      branches of industry, be likely to prove an impartial arbiter
      between them, ready to promote either, so far as it shall appear
      to him conducive to the general interests of the society? <a
      class="permalink" href="#p9">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p10">If we take into the account the momentary humors or
      dispositions which may happen to prevail in particular parts of
      the society, and to which a wise administration will never be
      inattentive, is the man whose situation leads to extensive inquiry
      and information less likely to be a competent judge of their
      nature, extent, and foundation than one whose observation does not
      travel beyond the circle of his neighbors and acquaintances? Is it
      not natural that a man who is a candidate for the favor of the
      people, and who is dependent on the suffrages of his
      fellow-citizens for the continuance of his public honors, should
      take care to inform himself of their dispositions and
      inclinations, and should be willing to allow them their proper
      degree of influence upon his conduct? This dependence, and the
      necessity of being bound himself, and his posterity, by the laws
      to which he gives his assent, are the true, and they are the
      strong chords of sympathy between the representative and the
      constituent. <a class="permalink" href="#p10">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p11">There is no part of the administration of government
      that requires extensive information and a thorough knowledge of
      the principles of political economy, so much as the business of
      taxation. The man who understands those principles best will be
      least likely to resort to oppressive expedients, or sacrifice any
      particular class of citizens to the procurement of revenue. It
      might be demonstrated that the most productive system of finance
      will always be the least burdensome. There can be no doubt that in
      order to a judicious exercise of the power of taxation, it is
      necessary that the person in whose hands it should be acquainted
      with the general genius, habits, and modes of thinking of the
      people at large, and with the resources of the country. And this
      is all that can be reasonably meant by a knowledge of the
      interests and feelings of the people. In any other sense the
      proposition has either no meaning, or an absurd one. And in that
      sense let every considerate citizen judge for himself where the
      requisite qualification is most likely to be found. <a
