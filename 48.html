      These Departments Should Not Be So Far Separated as to Have No
      Constitutional Control Over Each Other
    </h2>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><span class="initial">It was</span> shown in the last
      paper that the political apothegm there examined does not require
      that the legislative, executive, and judiciary departments should
      be wholly unconnected with each other. I shall undertake, in the
      next place, to show that unless these departments be so far
      connected and blended as to give to each a constitutional control
      over the others, the degree of separation which the maxim
      requires, as essential to a free government, can never in practice
      be duly maintained. <a class="permalink" href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">It is agreed on all sides, that the powers properly
      belonging to one of the departments ought not to be directly and
      completely administered by either of the other departments. It is
      equally evident, that none of them ought to possess, directly or
      indirectly, an overruling influence over the others, in the
      administration of their respective powers. It will not be denied,
      that power is of an encroaching nature, and that it ought to be
      effectually restrained from passing the limits assigned to it.
      After discriminating, therefore, in theory, the several classes of
      power, as they may in their nature be legislative, executive, or
      judiciary, the next and most difficult task is to provide some
      practical security for each, against the invasion of the others.
      What this security ought to be, is the great problem to be solved.
      <a class="permalink" href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">Will it be sufficient to mark, with precision, the
      boundaries of these departments, in the constitution of the
      government, and to trust to these parchment barriers against the
      encroaching spirit of power? This is the security which appears to
      have been principally relied on by the compilers of most of the
      American constitutions. But experience assures us, that the
      efficacy of the provision has been greatly overrated; and that
      some more adequate defense is indispensably necessary for the more
      feeble, against the more powerful, members of the government. The
      legislative department is everywhere extending the sphere of its
      activity, and drawing all power into its impetuous vortex. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">The founders of our republics have so much merit for
      the wisdom which they have displayed, that no task can be less
      pleasing than that of pointing out the errors into which they have
      fallen. A respect for truth, however, obliges us to remark, that
      they seem never for a moment to have turned their eyes from the
      danger to liberty from the overgrown and all-grasping prerogative
      of an hereditary magistrate, supported and fortified by an
      hereditary branch of the legislative authority. They seem never to
      have recollected the danger from legislative usurpations, which,
      by assembling all power in the same hands, must lead to the same
      tyranny as is threatened by executive usurpations. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">In a government where numerous and extensive
      prerogatives are placed in the hands of an hereditary monarch, the
      executive department is very justly regarded as the source of
      danger, and watched with all the jealousy which a zeal for liberty
      ought to inspire. In a democracy, where a multitude of people
      exercise in person the legislative functions, and are continually
      exposed, by their incapacity for regular deliberation and
      concerted measures, to the ambitious intrigues of their executive
      magistrates, tyranny may well be apprehended, on some favorable
      emergency, to start up in the same quarter. But in a
      representative republic, where the executive magistracy is
      carefully limited; both in the extent and the duration of its
      power; and where the legislative power is exercised by an
      assembly, which is inspired, by a supposed influence over the
      people, with an intrepid confidence in its own strength; which is
      sufficiently numerous to feel all the passions which actuate a
      multitude, yet not so numerous as to be incapable of pursuing the
      objects of its passions, by means which reason prescribes; it is
      against the enterprising ambition of this department that the
      people ought to indulge all their jealousy and exhaust all their
      precautions. <a class="permalink" href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">The legislative department derives a superiority in our
      governments from other circumstances. Its constitutional powers
      being at once more extensive, and less susceptible of precise
      limits, it can, with the greater facility, mask, under complicated
      and indirect measures, the encroachments which it makes on the
      co-ordinate departments. It is not unfrequently a question of real
      nicety in legislative bodies, whether the operation of a
      particular measure will, or will not, extend beyond the
      legislative sphere. On the other side, the executive power being
      restrained within a narrower compass, and being more simple in its
      nature, and the judiciary being described by landmarks still less
      uncertain, projects of usurpation by either of these departments
      would immediately betray and defeat themselves. Nor is this all:
      as the legislative department alone has access to the pockets of
      the people, and has in some constitutions full discretion, and in
      all a prevailing influence, over the pecuniary rewards of those
      who fill the other departments, a dependence is thus created in
      the latter, which gives still greater facility to encroachments of
      the former. <a class="permalink" href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p7">I have appealed to our own experience for the truth of
      what I advance on this subject. Were it necessary to verify this
      experience by particular proofs, they might be multiplied without
      end. I might find a witness in every citizen who has shared in, or
      been attentive to, the course of public administrations. I might
      collect vouchers in abundance from the records and archives of
      every State in the Union. But as a more concise, and at the same
      time equally satisfactory, evidence, I will refer to the example
      of two States, attested by two unexceptionable authorities. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p8">The first example is that of Virginia, a State which,
      as we have seen, has expressly declared in its constitution, that
      the three great departments ought not to be intermixed. The
      authority in support of it is Mr. Jefferson, who, besides his
      other advantages for remarking the operation of the government,
      was himself the chief magistrate of it. In order to convey fully
      the ideas with which his experience had impressed him on this
      subject, it will be necessary to quote a passage of some length
      from his very interesting &quot;Notes on the State of
      Virginia,&quot; p. 195. <q>All the powers of government,
      legislative, executive, and judiciary, result to the legislative
      body. The concentrating these in the same hands, is precisely the
      definition of despotic government. It will be no alleviation, that
      these powers will be exercised by a plurality of hands, and not by
      a single one. One hundred and seventy-three despots would surely
      be as oppressive as one. Let those who doubt it, turn their eyes
      on the republic of Venice. As little will it avail us, that they
      are chosen by ourselves. An <em>elective despotism</em> was not
      the government we fought for; but one which should not only be
      founded on free principles, but in which the powers of government
      should be so divided and balanced among several bodies of
      magistracy, as that no one could transcend their legal limits,
      without being effectually checked and restrained by the others.
      For this reason, that convention which passed the ordinance of
      government, laid its foundation on this basis, that the
      legislative, executive, and judiciary departments should be
      separate and distinct, so that no person should exercise the
      powers of more than one of them at the same time. <em>but no
      barrier was provided between these several powers</em>. The
      judiciary and the executive members were left dependent on the
      legislative for their subsistence in office, and some of them for
      their continuance in it. If, therefore, the legislature assumes
      executive and judiciary powers, no opposition is likely to be
      made; nor, if made, can be effectual; because in that case they
      may put their proceedings into the form of acts of Assembly, which
      will render them obligatory on the other branches. They have
      accordingly, <em>in many</em> instances, <em>decided rights</em>
      which should have been left to <em>judiciary controversy</em>, and
      <em>the direction of the executive, during the whole time of their
      session, is becoming habitual and familiar</em>.</q> <a
      class="permalink" href="#p8">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p9">The other State which I shall take for an example is
      Pennsylvania; and the other authority, the Council of Censors,
      which assembled in the years 1783 and 1784. A part of the duty of
      this body, as marked out by the constitution, was <q>to inquire
      whether the constitution had been preserved inviolate in every
      part; and whether the legislative and executive branches of
      government had performed their duty as guardians of the people, or
      assumed to themselves, or exercised, other or greater powers than
      they are entitled to by the constitution.</q> In the execution of
      this trust, the council were necessarily led to a comparison of
      both the legislative and executive proceedings, with the
      constitutional powers of these departments; and from the facts
      enumerated, and to the truth of most of which both sides in the
      council subscribed, it appears that the constitution had been
      flagrantly violated by the legislature in a variety of important
      instances. <a class="permalink" href="#p9">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p10">A great number of laws had been passed, violating,
      without any apparent necessity, the rule requiring that all bills
      of a public nature shall be previously printed for the
      consideration of the people; although this is one of the
      precautions chiefly relied on by the constitution against improper
      acts of legislature. <a class="permalink" href="#p10">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p11">The constitutional trial by jury had been violated,
      and powers assumed which had not been delegated by the
      constitution. <a class="permalink" href="#p11">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p12">Executive powers had been usurped. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p12">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p13">The salaries of the judges, which the constitution
      expressly requires to be fixed, had been occasionally varied; and
      cases belonging to the judiciary department frequently drawn
      within legislative cognizance and determination. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p13">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p14">Those who wish to see the several particulars falling
      under each of these heads, may consult the journals of the
      council, which are in print. Some of them, it will be found, may
      be imputable to peculiar circumstances connected with the war; but
      the greater part of them may be considered as the spontaneous
      shoots of an ill-constituted government. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p14">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p15">It appears, also, that the executive department had
      not been innocent of frequent breaches of the constitution. There
      are three observations, however, which ought to be made on this
      head: <em>first</em>, a great proportion of the instances were
      either immediately produced by the necessities of the war, or
      recommended by Congress or the commander-in-chief;
      <em>secondly</em>, in most of the other instances, they conformed
      either to the declared or the known sentiments of the legislative
      department; <em>thirdly</em>, the executive department of
      Pennsylvania is distinguished from that of the other States by the
      number of members composing it. In this respect, it has as much
      affinity to a legislative assembly as to an executive council. And
      being at once exempt from the restraint of an individual
      responsibility for the acts of the body, and deriving confidence
      from mutual example and joint influence, unauthorized measures
      would, of course, be more freely hazarded, than where the
      executive department is administered by a single hand, or by a few
      hands. <a class="permalink" href="#p15">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p16">The conclusion which I am warranted in drawing from
      these observations is, that a mere demarcation on parchment of the
      constitutional limits of the several departments, is not a
      sufficient guard against those encroachments which lead to a
      tyrannical concentration of all the powers of government in the
      same hands. <a class="permalink" href="#p16">&#182;</a></p>
