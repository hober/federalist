      The Insufficiency of the Present Confederation to Preserve the
      Union
    </h3>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><span class="initial">An objection</span>, of a nature
      different from that which has been stated and answered, in <a
      href="16">my last address</a>, may perhaps be likewise urged
      against the principle of legislation for the individual citizens
      of America. It may be said that it would tend to render the
      government of the Union too powerful, and to enable it to absorb
      those residuary authorities, which it might be judged proper to
      leave with the States for local purposes. Allowing the utmost
      latitude to the love of power which any reasonable man can
      require, I confess I am at a loss to discover what temptation the
      persons intrusted with the administration of the general
      government could ever feel to divest the States of the authorities
      of that description. The regulation of the mere domestic police of
      a State appears to me to hold out slender allurements to ambition.
      Commerce, finance, negotiation, and war seem to comprehend all the
      objects which have charms for minds governed by that passion; and
      all the powers necessary to those objects ought, in the first
      instance, to be lodged in the national depository. The
      administration of private justice between the citizens of the same
      State, the supervision of agriculture and of other concerns of a
      similar nature, all those things, in short, which are proper to be
      provided for by local legislation, can never be desirable cares of
      a general jurisdiction. It is therefore improbable that there
      should exist a disposition in the federal councils to usurp the
      powers with which they are connected; because the attempt to
      exercise those powers would be as troublesome as it would be
      nugatory; and the possession of them, for that reason, would
      contribute nothing to the dignity, to the importance, or to the
      splendor of the national government. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">But let it be admitted, for argument's sake, that mere
      wantonness and lust of domination would be sufficient to beget
      that disposition; still it may be safely affirmed, that the sense
      of the constituent body of the national representatives, or, in
      other words, the people of the several States, would control the
      indulgence of so extravagant an appetite. It will always be far
      more easy for the State governments to encroach upon the national
      authorities than for the national government to encroach upon the
      State authorities. The proof of this proposition turns upon the
      greater degree of influence which the State governments if they
      administer their affairs with uprightness and prudence, will
      generally possess over the people; a circumstance which at the
      same time teaches us that there is an inherent and intrinsic
      weakness in all federal constitutions; and that too much pains
      cannot be taken in their organization, to give them all the force
      which is compatible with the principles of liberty. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">The superiority of influence in favor of the particular
      governments would result partly from the diffusive construction of
      the national government, but chiefly from the nature of the
      objects to which the attention of the State administrations would
      be directed. <a class="permalink" href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">It is a known fact in human nature, that its affections
      are commonly weak in proportion to the distance or diffusiveness
      of the object. Upon the same principle that a man is more attached
      to his family than to his neighborhood, to his neighborhood than
      to the community at large, the people of each State would be apt
      to feel a stronger bias towards their local governments than
      towards the government of the Union; unless the force of that
      principle should be destroyed by a much better administration of
      the latter. <a class="permalink" href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">This strong propensity of the human heart would find
      powerful auxiliaries in the objects of State regulation. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">The variety of more minute interests, which will
      necessarily fall under the superintendence of the local
      administrations, and which will form so many rivulets of
      influence, running through every part of the society, cannot be
      particularized, without involving a detail too tedious and
      uninteresting to compensate for the instruction it might afford.
      <a class="permalink" href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p7">There is one transcendant advantage belonging to the
      province of the State governments, which alone suffices to place
      the matter in a clear and satisfactory light,&#8212;I mean the
      ordinary administration of criminal and civil justice. This, of
      all others, is the most powerful, most universal, and most
      attractive source of popular obedience and attachment. It is that
      which, being the immediate and visible guardian of life and
      property, having its benefits and its terrors in constant activity
      before the public eye, regulating all those personal interests and
      familiar concerns to which the sensibility of individuals is more
      immediately awake, contributes, more than any other circumstance,
      to impressing upon the minds of the people, affection, esteem, and
      reverence towards the government. This great cement of society,
      which will diffuse itself almost wholly through the channels of
      the particular governments, independent of all other causes of
      influence, would insure them so decided an empire over their
      respective citizens as to render them at all times a complete
      counterpoise, and, not unfrequently, dangerous rivals to the power
      of the Union. <a class="permalink" href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p8">The operations of the national government, on the other
      hand, falling less immediately under the observation of the mass
      of the citizens, the benefits derived from it will chiefly be
      perceived and attended to by speculative men. Relating to more
      general interests, they will be less apt to come home to the
      feelings of the people; and, in proportion, less likely to inspire
      an habitual sense of obligation, and an active sentiment of
      attachment. <a class="permalink" href="#p8">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p9">The reasoning on this head has been abundantly
      exemplified by the experience of all federal constitutions with
      which we are acquainted, and of all others which have borne the
      least analogy to them. <a class="permalink" href="#p9">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p10">Though the ancient feudal systems were not, strictly
      speaking, confederacies, yet they partook of the nature of that
      species of association. There was a common head, chieftain, or
      sovereign, whose authority extended over the whole nation; and a
      number of subordinate vassals, or feudatories, who had large
      portions of land allotted to them, and numerous trains of
      <em>inferior</em> vassals or retainers, who occupied and
      cultivated that land upon the tenure of fealty or obedience, to
      the persons of whom they held it. Each principal vassal was a kind
      of sovereign, within his particular demesnes. The consequences of
      this situation were a continual opposition to authority of the
      sovereign, and frequent wars between the great barons or chief
      feudatories themselves. The power of the head of the nation was
      commonly too weak, either to preserve the public peace, or to
      protect the people against the oppressions of their immediate
      lords. This period of European affairs is emphatically styled by
      historians, the times of feudal anarchy. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p10">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p11">When the sovereign happened to be a man of vigorous
      and warlike temper and of superior abilities, he would acquire a
      personal weight and influence, which answered, for the time, the
      purpose of a more regular authority. But in general, the power of
      the barons triumphed over that of the prince; and in many
      instances his dominion was entirely thrown off, and the great
      fiefs were erected into independent principalities or States. In
      those instances in which the monarch finally prevailed over his
      vassals, his success was chiefly owing to the tyranny of those
      vassals over their dependents. The barons, or nobles, equally the
      enemies of the sovereign and the oppressors of the common people,
      were dreaded and detested by both; till mutual danger and mutual
      interest effected a union between them fatal to the power of the
      aristocracy. Had the nobles, by a conduct of clemency and justice,
      preserved the fidelity and devotion of their retainers and
      followers, the contests between them and the prince must almost
      always have ended in their favor, and in the abridgment or
      subversion of the royal authority. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p11">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p12">This is not an assertion founded merely in speculation
      or conjecture. Among other illustrations of its truth which might
      be cited, Scotland will furnish a cogent example. The spirit of
      clanship which was, at an early day, introduced into that kingdom,
      uniting the nobles and their dependants by ties equivalent to
      those of kindred, rendered the aristocracy a constant overmatch
      for the power of the monarch, till the incorporation with England
      subdued its fierce and ungovernable spirit, and reduced it within
      those rules of subordination which a more rational and more
      energetic system of civil polity had previously established in the
      latter kingdom. <a class="permalink" href="#p12">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p13">The separate governments in a confederacy may aptly be
      compared with the feudal baronies; with this advantage in their
      favor, that from the reasons already explained, they will
      generally possess the confidence and good-will of the people, and
      with so important a support, will be able effectually to oppose
      all encroachments of the national government. It will be well if
      they are not able to counteract its legitimate and necessary
      authority. The points of similitude consist in the rivalship of
      power, applicable to both, and in the <em>concentration</em> of
      large portions of the strength of the community into particular
      <em>deposits</em>, in one case at the disposal of individuals, in
      the other case at the disposal of political bodies. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p13">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p14">A concise review of the events that have attended
      confederate governments will further illustrate this important
      doctrine; an inattention to which has been the great source of our
      political mistakes, and has given our jealousy a direction to the
      wrong side. This review shall form the subject of some ensuing
      papers. <a class="permalink" href="#p14">&#182;</a></p>
