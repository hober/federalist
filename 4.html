      Concerning Dangers From Foreign Force and Influence
    </h3>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><a href="3"><span class="initial">My last</span>
      paper</a> assigned several reasons why the safety of the people
      would be best secured by union against the danger it may be
      exposed to by <em>just</em> causes of war given to other nations;
      and those reasons show that such causes would not only be more
      rarely given, but would also be more easily accommodated, by a
      national government than either by the State governments or the
      proposed little confederacies. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">But the safety of the people of America against dangers
      from <em>foreign</em> force depends not only on their forbearing
      to give <em>just</em> causes of war to other nations, but also on
      their placing and continuing themselves in such a situation as not
      to <em>invite</em> hostility or insult; for it need not be
      observed that there are <em>pretended</em> as well as just causes
      of war. <a class="permalink" href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">It is too true, however disgraceful it may be to human
      nature, that nations in general will make war whenever they have a
      prospect of getting anything by it; nay, absolute monarchs will
      often make war when their nations are to get nothing by it, but
      for the purposes and objects merely personal, such as thirst for
      military glory, revenge for personal affronts, ambition, or
      private compacts to aggrandize or support their particular
      families or partisans. These and a variety of other motives, which
      affect only the mind of the sovereign, often lead him to engage in
      wars not sanctified by justice or the voice and interests of his
      people. But, independent of these inducements to war, which are
      more prevalent in absolute monarchies, but which well deserve our
      attention, there are others which affect nations as often as
      kings; and some of them will on examination be found to grow out
      of our relative situation and circumstances. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">With France and with Britain we are rivals in the
      fisheries, and can supply their markets cheaper than they can
      themselves, notwithstanding any efforts to prevent it by bounties
      on their own or duties on foreign fish. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">With them and with most other European nations we are
      rivals in navigation and the carrying trade; and we shall deceive
      ourselves if we suppose that any of them will rejoice to see it
      flourish; for, as our carrying trade cannot increase without in
      some degree diminishing theirs, it is more their interest, and
      will be more their policy, to restrain than to promote it. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">In the trade to China and India, we interfere with
      more than one nation, inasmuch as it enables us to partake in
      advantages which they had in a manner monopolized, and as we
      thereby supply ourselves with commodities which we used to
      purchase from them. <a class="permalink" href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p7">The extension of our own commerce in our own vessels
      cannot give pleasure to any nations who possess territories on or
      near this continent, because the cheapness and excellence of our
      productions, added to the circumstance of vicinity, and the
      enterprise and address of our merchants and navigators, will give
      us a greater share in the advantages which those territories
      afford, than consists with the wishes or policy of their
      respective sovereigns. <a class="permalink" href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p8">Spain thinks it convenient to shut the Mississippi
      against us on the one side, and Britain excludes us from the Saint
      Lawrence on the other; nor will either of them permit the other
      waters which are between them and us to become the means of mutual
      intercourse and traffic. <a class="permalink" href="#p8">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p9">From these and such like considerations, which might,
      if consistent with prudence, be more amplified and detailed, it is
      easy to see that jealousies and uneasinesses may gradually slide
      into the minds and cabinets of other nations, and that we are not
      to expect that they should regard our advancement in union, in
      power and consequence by land and by sea, with an eye of
      indifference and composure. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p9">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p10">The people of America are aware that inducements to
      war may arise out of these circumstances, as well as from others
      not so obvious at present, and that whenever such inducements may
      find fit time and opportunity for operation, pretenses to color
      and justify them will not be wanting. Wisely, therefore, do they
      consider union and a good national government as necessary to put
      and keep them in <em>such a situation</em> as, instead of
      <em>inviting</em> war, will tend to repress and discourage it.
      That situation consists in the best possible state of defense, and
      necessarily depends on the government, the arms, and the resources
      of the country. <a class="permalink" href="#p10">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p11">As the safety of the whole is the interest of the
      whole, and cannot be provided for without government, either one
      or more or many, let us inquire whether one good government is
      not, relative to the object in question, more competent than any
      other given number whatever. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p11">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p12">One government can collect and avail itself of the
      talents and experience of the ablest men, in whatever part of the
      Union they may be found. It can move on uniform principles of
      policy. It can harmonize, assimilate, and protect the several
      parts and members, and extend the benefit of its foresight and
      precautions to each. In the formation of treaties, it will regard
      the interest of the whole, and the particular interests of the
      parts as connected with that of the whole. It can apply the
      resources and power of the whole to the defense of any particular
      part, and that more easily and expeditiously than State
      governments or separate confederacies can possibly do, for want of
      concert and unity of system. It can place the militia under one
      plan of discipline, and, by putting their officers in a proper
      line of subordination to the Chief Magistrate, will, as it were,
      consolidate them into one corps, and thereby render them more
      efficient than if divided into thirteen or into three or four
      distinct independent companies. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p12">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p13">What would the militia of Britain be if the English
      militia obeyed the government of England, if the Scotch militia
      obeyed the government of Scotland, and if the Welsh militia obeyed
      the government of Wales? Suppose an invasion; would those three
      governments (if they agreed at all) be able, with all their
      respective forces, to operate against the enemy so effectually as
      the single government of Great Britain would? <a class="permalink"
      href="#p13">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p14">We have heard much of the fleets of Britain, and the
      time may come, if we are wise, when the fleets of America may
      engage attention. But if one national government, had not so
      regulated the navigation of Britain as to make it a nursery for
      seamen&#8212;if one national government had not called forth all
      the national means and materials for forming fleets, their prowess
      and their thunder would never have been celebrated. Let England
      have its navigation and fleet&#8212;let Scotland have its
      navigation and fleet&#8212;let Wales have its navigation and
      fleet&#8212;let Ireland have its navigation and fleet&#8212;let
      those four of the constituent parts of the British empire be be
      under four independent governments, and it is easy to perceive how
      soon they would each dwindle into comparative insignificance. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p14">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p15">Apply these facts to our own case. Leave America
      divided into thirteen or, if you please, into three or four
      independent governments&#8212;what armies could they raise and
      pay&#8212;what fleets could they ever hope to have? If one was
      attacked, would the others fly to its succor, and spend their
      blood and money in its defense? Would there be no danger of their
      being flattered into neutrality by its specious promises, or
      seduced by a too great fondness for peace to decline hazarding
      their tranquillity and present safety for the sake of neighbors,
      of whom perhaps they have been jealous, and whose importance they
      are content to see diminished? Although such conduct would not be
      wise, it would, nevertheless, be natural. The history of the
      states of Greece, and of other countries, abounds with such
      instances, and it is not improbable that what has so often
      happened would, under similar circumstances, happen again. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p15">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p16">But admit that they might be willing to help the
      invaded State or confederacy. How, and when, and in what
      proportion shall aids of men and money be afforded? Who shall
      command the allied armies, and from which of them shall he receive
      his orders? Who shall settle the terms of peace, and in case of
      disputes what umpire shall decide between them and compel
      acquiescence? Various difficulties and inconveniences would be
      inseparable from such a situation; whereas one government,
      watching over the general and common interests, and combining and
      directing the powers and resources of the whole, would be free
      from all these embarrassments, and conduce far more to the safety
      of the people. <a class="permalink" href="#p16">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p17">But whatever may be our situation, whether firmly
      united under one national government, or split into a number of
      confederacies, certain it is, that foreign nations will know and
      view it exactly as it is; and they will act toward us accordingly.
      If they see that our national government is efficient and well
      administered, our trade prudently regulated, our militia properly
      organized and disciplined, our resources and finances discreetly
      managed, our credit re-established, our people free, contented,
      and united, they will be much more disposed to cultivate our
      friendship than provoke our resentment. If, on the other hand,
      they find us either destitute of an effectual government (each
      State doing right or wrong, as to its rulers may seem convenient),
      or split into three or four independent and probably discordant
      republics or confederacies, one inclining to Britain, another to
      France, and a third to Spain, and perhaps played off against each
      other by the three, what a poor, pitiful figure will America make
      in their eyes! How liable would she become not only to their
      contempt but to their outrage, and how soon would dear-bought
      experience proclaim that when a people or family so divide, it
      never fails to be against themselves. <a class="permalink"
