      Concerning the Power of Congress to Regulate the Election of

      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><span>The</span> more candid opposers of <a
      href="constitution#a1s4">the provision respecting elections</a>,
      contained in the plan of the convention, when pressed in argument,
      will sometimes concede the propriety of that provision; with this
      qualification, however, that it ought to have been accompanied
      with a declaration, that all elections should be had in the
      counties where the electors resided. This, say they, was a
      necessary precaution against an abuse of the power. A declaration
      of this nature would certainly have been harmless; so far as it
      would have had the effect of quieting apprehensions, it might not
      have been undesirable. But it would, in fact, have afforded little
      or no additional security against the danger apprehended; and the
      want of it will never be considered, by an impartial and judicious
      examiner, as a serious, still less as an insuperable, objection to
      the plan. The different views taken of the subject in the two
      preceding papers must be sufficient to satisfy all dispassionate
      and discerning men, that if the public liberty should ever be the
      victim of the ambition of the national rulers, the power under
      examination, at least, will be guiltless of the sacrifice. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">If those who are inclined to consult their jealousy
      only, would exercise it in a careful inspection of the several
      State constitutions, they would find little less room for
      disquietude and alarm, from the latitude which most of them allow
      in respect to elections, than from the latitude which is proposed
      to be allowed to the national government in the same respect. A
      review of their situation, in this particular, would tend greatly
      to remove any ill impressions which may remain in regard to this
      matter. But as that view would lead into long and tedious details,
      I shall content myself with the single example of the State in
      which I write. The constitution of New York makes no other
      provision for <em>locality</em> of elections, than that the
      members of the Assembly shall be elected in the <em>counties</em>;
      those of the Senate, in the great districts into which the State
      is or may be divided: these at present are four in number, and
      comprehend each from two to six counties. It may readily be
      perceived that it would not be more difficult to the legislature
      of New York to defeat the suffrages of the citizens of New York,
      by confining elections to particular places, than for the
      legislature of the United States to defeat the suffrages of the
      citizens of the Union, by the like expedient. Suppose, for
      instance, the city of Albany was to be appointed the sole place of
      election for the county and district of which it is a part, would
      not the inhabitants of that city speedily become the only electors
      of the members both of the Senate and Assembly for that county and
      district? Can we imagine that the electors who reside in the
      remote subdivisions of the counties of Albany, Saratoga,
      Cambridge, etc., or in any part of the county of Montgomery, would
      take the trouble to come to the city of Albany, to give their
      votes for members of the Assembly or Senate, sooner than they
      would repair to the city of New York, to participate in the choice
      of the members of the federal House of Representatives? The
      alarming indifference discoverable in the exercise of so
      invaluable a privilege under the existing laws, which afford every
      facility to it, furnishes a ready answer to this question. And,
      abstracted from any experience on the subject, we can be at no
      loss to determine, that when the place of election is at an
      <em>inconvenient distance</em> from the elector, the effect upon
      his conduct will be the same whether that distance be twenty miles
      or twenty thousand miles. Hence it must appear, that objections to
      the particular modification of the federal power of regulating
      elections will, in substance, apply with equal force to the
      modification of the like power in the constitution of this State;
      and for this reason it will be impossible to acquit the one, and
      to condemn the other. A similar comparison would lead to the same
      conclusion in respect to the constitutions of most of the other
      States. <a class="permalink" href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">If it should be said that defects in the State
      constitutions furnish no apology for those which are to be found
      in the plan proposed, I answer, that as the former have never been
      thought chargeable with inattention to the security of liberty,
      where the imputations thrown on the latter can be shown to be
      applicable to them also, the presumption is that they are rather
      the cavilling refinements of a predetermined opposition, than the
      well-founded inferences of a candid research after truth. To those
      who are disposed to consider, as innocent omissions in the State
      constitutions, what they regard as unpardonable blemishes in the
      plan of the convention, nothing can be said; or at most, they can
      only be asked to assign some substantial reason why the
      representatives of the people in a single State should be more
      impregnable to the lust of power, or other sinister motives, than
      the representatives of the people of the United States? If they
      cannot do this, they ought at least to prove to us that it is
      easier to subvert the liberties of three millions of people, with
      the advantage of local governments to head their opposition, than
      of two hundred thousand people who are destitute of that
      advantage. And in relation to the point immediately under
      consideration, they ought to convince us that it is less probable
      that a predominant faction in a single State should, in order to
      maintain its superiority, incline to a preference of a particular
      class of electors, than that a similar spirit should take
      possession of the representatives of thirteen States, spread over
      a vast region, and in several respects distinguishable from each
      other by a diversity of local circumstances, prejudices, and
      interests. <a class="permalink" href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">Hitherto my observations have only aimed at a
      vindication of the provision in question, on the ground of
      theoretic propriety, on that of the danger of placing the power
      elsewhere, and on that of the safety of placing it in the manner
      proposed. But there remains to be mentioned a positive advantage
      which will result from this disposition, and which could not as
      well have been obtained from any other: I allude to the
      circumstance of uniformity in the time of elections for the
      federal House of Representatives. It is more than possible that
      this uniformity may be found by experience to be of great
      importance to the public welfare, both as a security against the
      perpetuation of the same spirit in the body, and as a cure for the
      diseases of faction. If each State may choose its own time of
      election, it is possible there may be at least as many different
      periods as there are months in the year. The times of election in
      the several States, as they are now established for local
      purposes, vary between extremes as wide as March and November. The
      consequence of this diversity would be that there could never
      happen a total dissolution or renovation of the body at one time.
      If an improper spirit of any kind should happen to prevail in it,
      that spirit would be apt to infuse itself into the new members, as
      they come forward in succession. The mass would be likely to
      remain nearly the same, assimilating constantly to itself its
      gradual accretions. There is a contagion in example which few men
      have sufficient force of mind to resist. I am inclined to think
      that treble the duration in office, with the condition of a total
      dissolution of the body at the same time, might be less formidable
      to liberty than one third of that duration subject to gradual and
      successive alterations. <a class="permalink" href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">Uniformity in the time of elections seems not less
      requisite for executing the idea of a regular rotation in the
      Senate, and for conveniently assembling the legislature at a
      stated period in each year. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">It may be asked, Why, then, could not a time have been
      fixed in the Constitution? As the most zealous adversaries of the
      plan of the convention in this State are, in general, not less
      zealous admirers of the constitution of the State, the question
      may be retorted, and it may be asked, Why was not a time for the
      like purpose fixed in the constitution of this State? No better
      answer can be given than that it was a matter which might safely
      be entrusted to legislative discretion; and that if a time had
      been appointed, it might, upon experiment, have been found less
      convenient than some other time. The same answer may be given to
      the question put on the other side. And it may be added that the
      supposed danger of a gradual change being merely speculative, it
      would have been hardly advisable upon that speculation to
      establish, as a fundamental point, what would deprive several
      States of the convenience of having the elections for their own
      governments and for the national government at the same epochs. <a
