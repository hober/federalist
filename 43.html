      The Powers Conferred by the Constitution Further Considered
    </h3>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><span class="initial">The</span> <em>fourth</em> class
      comprises the following miscellaneous powers: <a class="permalink"
      href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">1. A <a href="constitution#a1s8c8">power</a> <q
      cite="constitution#a1s8c8">to promote the progress of science and
      useful arts, by securing, for a limited time, to authors and
      inventors, the exclusive right to their respective writings and
      discoveries.</q> <a class="permalink" href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">The utility of this power will scarcely be
      questioned. The copyright of authors has been solemnly adjudged,
      in Great Britain, to be a right of common law. The right to useful
      inventions seems with equal reason to belong to the inventors. The
      public good fully coincides in both cases with the claims of
      individuals. The States cannot separately make effectual
      provisions for either of the cases, and most of them have
      anticipated the decision of this point, by laws passed at the
      instance of Congress. <a class="permalink" href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">2. <q cite="constitution#a1s8c17">To <a
      href="constitution#a1s8c17">exercise exclusive legislation</a>, in
      all cases whatsoever, over such district (not exceeding ten miles
      square) as may, by cession of particular States and the acceptance
      of Congress, become the seat of the government of the United
      States; and to exercise like authority over all places purchased
      by the consent of the legislatures of the States in which the same
      shall be, for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals,
      dockyards, and other needful buildings.</q> <a class="permalink"
      href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">The indispensable necessity of complete authority at
      the seat of government, carries its own evidence with it. It is a
      power exercised by every legislature of the Union, I might say of
      the world, by virtue of its general supremacy. Without it, not
      only the public authority might be insulted and its proceedings
      interrupted with impunity; but a dependence of the members of the
      general government on the State comprehending the seat of the
      government, for protection in the exercise of their duty, might
      bring on the national councils an imputation of awe or influence,
      equally dishonorable to the government and dissatisfactory to the
      other members of the Confederacy. This consideration has the more
      weight, as the gradual accumulation of public improvements at the
      stationary residence of the government would be both too great a
      public pledge to be left in the hands of a single State, and would
      create so many obstacles to a removal of the government, as still
      further to abridge its necessary independence. The extent of this
      federal district is sufficiently circumscribed to satisfy every
      jealousy of an opposite nature. And as it is to be appropriated to
      this use with the consent of the State ceding it; as the State
      will no doubt provide in the compact for the rights and the
      consent of the citizens inhabiting it; as the inhabitants will
      find sufficient inducements of interest to become willing parties
      to the cession; as they will have had their voice in the election
      of the government which is to exercise authority over them; as a
      municipal legislature for local purposes, derived from their own
      suffrages, will of course be allowed them; and as the authority of
      the legislature of the State, and of the inhabitants of the ceded
      part of it, to concur in the cession, will be derived from the
      whole people of the State in their adoption of the Constitution,
      every imaginable objection seems to be obviated. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">The necessity of a like authority over forts,
      magazines, etc., established by the general government, is not
      less evident. The public money expended on such places, and the
      public property deposited in them, requires that they should be
      exempt from the authority of the particular State. Nor would it be
      proper for the places on which the security of the entire Union
      may depend, to be in any degree dependent on a particular member
      of it. All objections and scruples are here also obviated, by
      requiring the concurrence of the States concerned, in every such
      establishment. <a class="permalink" href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p7">3. <q cite="constitution#a3s3c1">To <a
      href="constitution#a3s3c1">declare the punishment of treason</a>,
      but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or
      forfeiture, except during the life of the person attained.</q> <a
      class="permalink" href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p8">As treason may be committed against the United States,
      the authority of the United States ought to be enabled to punish
      it. But as new-fangled and artificial treasons have been the great
      engines by which violent factions, the natural offspring of free
      government, have usually wreaked their alternate malignity on each
      other, the convention have, with great judgment, opposed a barrier
      to this peculiar danger, by inserting a constitutional definition
      of the crime, fixing the proof necessary for conviction of it, and
      restraining the Congress, even in punishing it, from extending the
      consequences of guilt beyond the person of its author. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p8">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p9">4. <q cite="constitution#a4s3c1">To <a
      href="constitution#a4s3c1">admit new States</a> into the Union;
      but no new State shall be formed or erected within the
      jurisdiction of any other State; nor any State be formed by the
      junction of two or more States, or parts of States, without the
      consent of the legislatures of the States concerned, as well as of
      the Congress.</q> <a class="permalink" href="#p9">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p10">In the articles of Confederation, no provision is
      found on this important subject. <a href="articles#a11">Canada was
      to be admitted of right</a>, on her joining in the measures of the
      United States; and the other <em>colonies</em>, by which were
      evidently meant the other British colonies, at the discretion of
      nine States. The eventual establishment of <em>new states</em>
      seems to have been overlooked by the compilers of that instrument.
      We have seen the inconvenience of this omission, and the
      assumption of power into which Congress have been led by it. With
      great propriety, therefore, has the new system supplied the
      defect. The general precaution, that no new States shall be
      formed, without the concurrence of the federal authority, and that
      of the States concerned, is consonant to the principles which
      ought to govern such transactions. The particular precaution
      against the erection of new States, by the partition of a State
      without its consent, quiets the jealousy of the larger States; as
      that of the smaller is quieted by a like precaution, against a
      junction of States without their consent. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p10">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p11">5. <q cite="constitution#a4s3c2">To <a
      href="constitution#a4s3c2">dispose of and make all needful rules
      and regulations respecting the territory</a> or other property
      belonging to the United States, with a proviso, that nothing in
      the Constitution shall be so construed as to prejudice any claims
      of the United States, or of any particular State.</q> <a
      class="permalink" href="#p11">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p12">This is a power of very great importance, and
      required by considerations similar to those which show the
      propriety of the former. The proviso annexed is proper in itself,
      and was probably rendered absolutely necessary by jealousies and
      questions concerning the Western territory sufficiently known to
      the public. <a class="permalink" href="#p12">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p13">6. <q cite="constitution#a4s4">To <a
      href="constitution#a4s4">guarantee to every State</a> in the Union
      a republican form of government; to protect each of them against
      invasion; and on application of the legislature, or of the
      executive (when the legislature cannot be convened), against
      domestic violence.</q> <a class="permalink" href="#p13">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p14">In a confederacy founded on republican principles, and
      composed of republican members, the superintending government
      ought clearly to possess authority to defend the system against
      aristocratic or monarchial innovations. The more intimate the
      nature of such a union may be, the greater interest have the
      members in the political institutions of each other; and the
      greater right to insist that the forms of government under which
      the compact was entered into should be <em>substantially</em>
      maintained. But a right implies a remedy; and where else could the
      remedy be deposited, than where it is deposited by the
      Constitution? Governments of dissimilar principles and forms have
      been found less adapted to a federal coalition of any sort, than
      those of a kindred nature. <q>As the confederate republic of
      Germany,</q> says Montesquieu, <q>consists of free cities and
      petty states, subject to different princes, experience shows us
      that it is more imperfect than that of Holland and
      Switzerland.</q> <q>Greece was undone,</q> he adds, <q>as soon as
      the king of Macedon obtained a seat among the Amphictyons.</q> In
      the latter case, no doubt, the disproportionate force, as well as
      the monarchical form, of the new confederate, had its share of
      influence on the events. It may possibly be asked, what need there
      could be of such a precaution, and whether it may not become a
      pretext for alterations in the State governments, without the
      concurrence of the States themselves. These questions admit of
      ready answers. If the interposition of the general government
      should not be needed, the provision for such an event will be a
      harmless superfluity only in the Constitution. But who can say
      what experiments may be produced by the caprice of particular
      States, by the ambition of enterprising leaders, or by the
      intrigues and influence of foreign powers? To the second question
      it may be answered, that if the general government should
      interpose by virtue of this constitutional authority, it will be,
      of course, bound to pursue the authority. But the authority
      extends no further than to a <em>guaranty</em> of a republican
      form of government, which supposes a pre-existing government of
      the form which is to be guaranteed. As long, therefore, as the
      existing republican forms are continued by the States, they are
      guaranteed by the federal Constitution. Whenever the States may
      choose to substitute other republican forms, they have a right to
      do so, and to claim the federal guaranty for the latter. The only
      restriction imposed on them is, that they shall not exchange
      republican for antirepublican Constitutions; a restriction which,
      it is presumed, will hardly be considered as a grievance. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p14">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p15">A protection against invasion is due from every
      society to the parts composing it. The latitude of the expression
      here used seems to secure each State, not only against foreign
      hostility, but against ambitious or vindictive enterprises of its
      more powerful neighbors. The history, both of ancient and modern
      confederacies, proves that the weaker members of the union ought
      not to be insensible to the policy of this article. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p15">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p16">Protection against domestic violence is added with
      equal propriety. It has been remarked, that even among the Swiss
      cantons, which, properly speaking, are not under one government,
      provision is made for this object; and the history of that league
      informs us that mutual aid is frequently claimed and afforded; and
      as well by the most democratic, as the other cantons. <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shays'_Rebellion">A recent and
      well-known event among ourselves</a> has warned us to be prepared
      for emergencies of a like nature. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p16">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p17">At first view, it might seem not to square with the
      republican theory, to suppose, either that a majority have not the
      right, or that a minority will have the force, to subvert a
      government; and consequently, that the federal interposition can
      never be required, but when it would be improper. But theoretic
      reasoning, in this as in most other cases, must be qualified by
      the lessons of practice. Why may not illicit combinations, for
      purposes of violence, be formed as well by a majority of a State,
      especially a small State as by a majority of a county, or a
      district of the same State; and if the authority of the State
      ought, in the latter case, to protect the local magistracy, ought
      not the federal authority, in the former, to support the State
      authority? Besides, there are certain parts of the State
      constitutions which are so interwoven with the federal
      Constitution, that a violent blow cannot be given to the one
      without communicating the wound to the other. Insurrections in a
      State will rarely induce a federal interposition, unless the
      number concerned in them bear some proportion to the friends of
      government. It will be much better that the violence in such cases
      should be repressed by the superintending power, than that the
      majority should be left to maintain their cause by a bloody and
      obstinate contest. The existence of a right to interpose, will
      generally prevent the necessity of exerting it. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p17">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p18">Is it true that force and right are necessarily on the
      same side in republican governments? May not the minor party
      possess such a superiority of pecuniary resources, of military
      talents and experience, or of secret succors from foreign powers,
      as will render it superior also in an appeal to the sword? May not
      a more compact and advantageous position turn the scale on the
      same side, against a superior number so situated as to be less
      capable of a prompt and collected exertion of its strength?
      Nothing can be more chimerical than to imagine that in a trial of
      actual force, victory may be calculated by the rules which prevail
      in a census of the inhabitants, or which determine the event of an
      election! May it not happen, in fine, that the minority of
      <em>citizens</em> may become a majority of <em>persons</em>, by
      the accession of alien residents, of a casual concourse of
      adventurers, or of those whom the constitution of the State has
      not admitted to the rights of suffrage? I take no notice of an
      unhappy species of population abounding in some of the States,
      who, during the calm of regular government, are sunk below the
      level of men; but who, in the tempestuous scenes of civil
      violence, may emerge into the human character, and give a
      superiority of strength to any party with which they may associate
      themselves. <a class="permalink" href="#p18">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p19">In cases where it may be doubtful on which side
      justice lies, what better umpires could be desired by two violent
      factions, flying to arms, and tearing a State to pieces, than the
      representatives of confederate States, not heated by the local
      flame? To the impartiality of judges, they would unite the
      affection of friends. Happy would it be if such a remedy for its
      infirmities could be enjoyed by all free governments; if a project
      equally effectual could be established for the universal peace of
      mankind! <a class="permalink" href="#p19">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p20">Should it be asked, what is to be the redress for an
      insurrection pervading all the States, and comprising a
      superiority of the entire force, though not a constitutional
      right? the answer must be, that such a case, as it would be
      without the compass of human remedies, so it is fortunately not
      within the compass of human probability; and that it is a
      sufficient recommendation of the federal Constitution, that it
      diminishes the risk of a calamity for which no possible
      constitution can provide a cure. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p20">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p21">Among the advantages of a confederate republic
      enumerated by Montesquieu, an important one is, <q>that should a
      popular insurrection happen in one of the States, the others are
      able to quell it. Should abuses creep into one part, they are
      reformed by those that remain sound.</q> <a class="permalink"
      href="#p21">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p22">7. <q cite="constitution#a6c1">To consider all debts
      contracted, and engagements entered into, before the adoption of
      this Constitution, as being <a href="constitution#a6c1">no less
      valid</a> against the United States, under this Constitution, than
      under the Confederation.</q> <a class="permalink"
      href="#p22">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p23">This can only be considered as a declaratory
      proposition; and may have been inserted, among other reasons, for
      the satisfaction of the foreign creditors of the United States,
      who cannot be strangers to the pretended doctrine, that a change
      in the political form of civil society has the magical effect of
      dissolving its moral obligations. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p23">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p24">Among the lesser criticisms which have been exercised
      on the Constitution, it has been remarked that the validity of
      engagements ought to have been asserted in favor of the United
      States, as well as against them; and in the spirit which usually
      characterizes little critics, the omission has been transformed
      and magnified into a plot against the national rights. The authors
      of this discovery may be told, what few others need to be informed
      of, that as engagements are in their nature reciprocal, an
      assertion of their validity on one side, necessarily involves a
      validity on the other side; and that as the article is merely
      declaratory, the establishment of the principle in one case is
      sufficient for every case. They may be further told, that every
      constitution must limit its precautions to dangers that are not
      altogether imaginary; and that no real danger can exist that the
      government would <em>dare</em>, with, or even without, this
      constitutional declaration before it, to remit the debts justly
      due to the public, on the pretext here condemned. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p24">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p25">8. <q cite="constitution#a5">To <a
      href="constitution#a5">provide for amendments</a> to be ratified
      by three fourths of the States under two exceptions only.</q> <a
      class="permalink" href="#p25">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p26">That useful alterations will be suggested by
      experience, could not but be foreseen. It was requisite,
      therefore, that a mode for introducing them should be provided.
      The mode preferred by the convention seems to be stamped with
      every mark of propriety. It guards equally against that extreme
      facility, which would render the Constitution too mutable; and
      that extreme difficulty, which might perpetuate its discovered
      faults. It, moreover, equally enables the general and the State
      governments to originate the amendment of errors, as they may be
      pointed out by the experience on one side, or on the other. The
      exception in favor of the equality of suffrage in the Senate, was
      probably meant as a palladium to the residuary sovereignty of the
      States, implied and secured by that principle of representation in
      one branch of the legislature; and was probably insisted on by the
      States particularly attached to that equality. The other exception
      must have been admitted on the same considerations which produced
      the privilege defended by it. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p26">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p27">9. <q cite="constitution#a7">The <a
      href="constitution#a7">ratification of the conventions of nine
      States</a> shall be sufficient for the establishment of this
      Constitution between the States, ratifying the same.</q> <a
      class="permalink" href="#p27">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p28">This article speaks for itself. The express authority
      of the people alone could give due validity to the Constitution.
      To have required the unanimous ratification of the thirteen
      States, would have subjected the essential interests of the whole
      to the caprice or corruption of a single member. It would have
      marked a want of foresight in the convention, which our own
      experience would have rendered inexcusable. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p28">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p29">Two questions of a very delicate nature present
      themselves on this occasion: 1. On what principle the
      Confederation, which stands in the solemn form of a compact among
      the States, can be superseded without the unanimous consent of the
      parties to it? 2. What relation is to subsist between the nine or
      more States ratifying the Constitution, and the remaining few who
      do not become parties to it? <a class="permalink"
      href="#p29">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p30">The first question is answered at once by recurring to
      the absolute necessity of the case; to the great principle of
      self-preservation; to the transcendent law of nature and of
      nature's God, which declares that the safety and happiness of
      society are the objects at which all political institutions aim,
      and to which all such institutions must be sacrificed.
      <em>Perhaps</em>, also, an answer may be found without searching
      beyond the principles of the compact itself. It has been
      heretofore noted among the defects of the Confederation, that in
      many of the States it had received no higher sanction than a mere
      legislative ratification. The principle of reciprocality seems to
      require that its obligation on the other States should be reduced
      to the same standard. A compact between independent sovereigns,
      founded on ordinary acts of legislative authority, can pretend to
      no higher validity than a league or treaty between the parties. It
      is an established doctrine on the subject of treaties, that all
      the articles are mutually conditions of each other; that a breach
      of any one article is a breach of the whole treaty; and that a
      breach, committed by either of the parties, absolves the others,
      and authorizes them, if they please, to pronounce the compact
      violated and void. Should it unhappily be necessary to appeal to
      these delicate truths for a justification for dispensing with the
      consent of particular States to a dissolution of the federal pact,
      will not the complaining parties find it a difficult task to
      answer the <em>multiplied</em> and <em>important</em> infractions
      with which they may be confronted? The time has been when it was
      incumbent on us all to veil the ideas which this paragraph
      exhibits. The scene is now changed, and with it the part which the
      same motives dictate. <a class="permalink" href="#p30">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p31">The second question is not less delicate; and the
      flattering prospect of its being merely hypothetical forbids an
      overcurious discussion of it. It is one of those cases which must
      be left to provide for itself. In general, it may be observed,
      that although no political relation can subsist between the
      assenting and dissenting States, yet the moral relations will
      remain uncancelled. The claims of justice, both on one side and on
      the other, will be in force, and must be fulfilled; the rights of
      humanity must in all cases be duly and mutually respected; whilst
      considerations of a common interest, and, above all, the
      remembrance of the endearing scenes which are past, and the
      anticipation of a speedy triumph over the obstacles to reunion,
      will, it is hoped, not urge in vain <em>moderation</em> on one
      side, and <em>prudence</em> on the other. <a class="permalink"
