    <h2 class="entry-summary">The Appointing Power of the Executive</h2>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><span class="initial">The</span> President is <q
      cite="constitution#a2s2c2"><a href="constitution#a2s2c2">to
      <em>nominate</em></a>, and, by and with the advice and consent of
      the Senate, to appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and
      consuls, judges of the Supreme Court, and all other officers of
      the United States whose appointments are not otherwise provided
      for in the Constitution. But the Congress may by law vest the
      appointment of such inferior officers as they think proper, in the
      President alone, or in the courts of law, or in the heads of
      departments. The President shall have power to fill up <em>all
      vacancies</em> which may happen <em>during the recess of the
      senate</em>, by granting commissions which shall <em>expire</em>
      at the end of their next session.</q> <a class="permalink"
      href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">It has been observed in a former paper, that <q>the
      true test of a good government is its aptitude and tendency to
      produce a good administration.</q> If the justness of this
      observation be admitted, the mode of appointing the officers of
      the United States contained in the foregoing clauses, must, when
      examined, be allowed to be entitled to particular commendation. It
      is not easy to conceive a plan better calculated than this to
      promote a judicious choice of men for filling the offices of the
      Union; and it will not need proof, that on this point must
      essentially depend the character of its administration. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">It will be agreed on all hands, that the power of
      appointment, in ordinary cases, ought to be modified in one of
      three ways. It ought either to be vested in a single man, or in a
      <em>select</em> assembly of a moderate number; or in a single man,
      with the concurrence of such an assembly. The exercise of it by
      the people at large will be readily admitted to be impracticable;
      as waiving every other consideration, it would leave them little
      time to do anything else. When, therefore, mention is made in the
      subsequent reasonings of an assembly or body of men, what is said
      must be understood to relate to a select body or assembly, of the
      description already given. The people collectively, from their
      number and from their dispersed situation, cannot be regulated in
      their movements by that systematic spirit of cabal and intrigue,
      which will be urged as the chief objections to reposing the power
      in question in a body of men. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">Those who have themselves reflected upon the subject,
      or who have attended to the observations made in other parts of
      these papers, in relation to the appointment of the President,
      will, I presume, agree to the position, that there would always be
      great probability of having the place supplied by a man of
      abilities, at least respectable. Premising this, I proceed to lay
      it down as a rule, that one man of discernment is better fitted to
      analyze and estimate the peculiar qualities adapted to particular
      offices, than a body of men of equal or perhaps even of superior
      discernment. <a class="permalink" href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">The sole and undivided responsibility of one man will
      naturally beget a livelier sense of duty and a more exact regard
      to reputation. He will, on this account, feel himself under
      stronger obligations, and more interested to investigate with care
      the qualities requisite to the stations to be filled, and to
      prefer with impartiality the persons who may have the fairest
      pretensions to them. He will have <em>fewer</em> personal
      attachments to gratify, than a body of men who may each be
      supposed to have an equal number; and will be so much the less
      liable to be misled by the sentiments of friendship and of
      affection. A single well-directed man, by a single understanding,
      cannot be distracted and warped by that diversity of views,
      feelings, and interests, which frequently distract and warp the
      resolutions of a collective body. There is nothing so apt to
      agitate the passions of mankind as personal considerations whether
      they relate to ourselves or to others, who are to be the objects
      of our choice or preference. Hence, in every exercise of the power
      of appointing to offices, by an assembly of men, we must expect to
      see a full display of all the private and party likings and
      dislikes, partialities and antipathies, attachments and
      animosities, which are felt by those who compose the assembly. The
      choice which may at any time happen to be made under such
      circumstances, will of course be the result either of a victory
      gained by one party over the other, or of a compromise between the
      parties. In either case, the intrinsic merit of the candidate will
      be too often out of sight. In the first, the qualifications best
      adapted to uniting the suffrages of the party, will be more
      considered than those which fit the person for the station. In the
      last, the coalition will commonly turn upon some interested
      equivalent: "Give us the man we wish for this office, and you
      shall have the one you wish for that." This will be the usual
      condition of the bargain. And it will rarely happen that the
      advancement of the public service will be the primary object
      either of party victories or of party negotiations. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">The truth of the principles here advanced seems to have
      been felt by the most intelligent of those who have found fault
      with the provision made, in this respect, by the convention. They
      contend that the President ought solely to have been authorized to
      make the appointments under the federal government. But it is easy
      to show, that every advantage to be expected from such an
      arrangement would, in substance, be derived from the power of
      <em>nomination</em>, which is proposed to be conferred upon him;
      while several disadvantages which might attend the absolute power
      of appointment in the hands of that officer would be avoided. In
      the act of nomination, his judgment alone would be exercised; and
      as it would be his sole duty to point out the man who, with the
      approbation of the Senate, should fill an office, his
      responsibility would be as complete as if he were to make the
      final appointment. There can, in this view, be no difference
      others, who are to be the objects of our choice or preference.
      Hence, in every exercise of the power of appointing to offices, by
      an assembly of men, we must expect to see a full display of all
      the private and party likings and dislikes, partialities and
      antipathies, attachments and animosities, which are felt by those
      who compose the assembly. The choice which may at any time happen
      to be made under such circumstances, will of course be the result
      either of a victory gained by one party over the other, or of a
      compromise between the parties. In either case, the intrinsic
      merit of the candidate will be too often out of sight. In the
      first, the qualifications best adapted to uniting the suffrages of
      the party, will be more considered than those which fit the person
      for the station. In the last, the coalition will commonly turn
      upon some interested equivalent: <q>Give us the man we wish for
      this office, and you shall have the one you wish for that.</q>
      This will be the usual condition of the bargain. And it will
      rarely happen that the advancement of the public service will be
      the primary object either of party victories or of party
      negotiations. <a class="permalink" href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p7">The truth of the principles here advanced seems to have
      been felt by the most intelligent of those who have found fault
      with the provision made, in this respect, by the convention. They
      contend that the President ought solely to have been authorized to
      make the appointments under the federal government. But it is easy
      to show, that every advantage to be expected from such an
      arrangement would, in substance, be derived from the power of
      <em>nomination</em>, which is proposed to be conferred upon him;
      while several disadvantages which might attend the absolute power
      of appointment in the hands of that officer would be avoided. In
      the act of nomination, his judgment alone would be exercised; and
      as it would be his sole duty to point out the man who, with the
      approbation of the Senate, should fill an office, his
      responsibility would be as complete as if he were to make the
      final appointment. There can, in this view, be no difference
      between nominating and appointing. The same motives which would
      influence a proper discharge of his duty in one case, would exist
      in the other. And as no man could be appointed but on his previous
      nomination, every man who might be appointed would be, in fact,
      his choice. <a class="permalink" href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p8">But might not his nomination be overruled? I grant it
      might, yet this could only be to make place for another nomination
      by himself. The person ultimately appointed must be the object of
      his preference, though perhaps not in the first degree. It is also
      not very probable that his nomination would often be overruled.
      The Senate could not be tempted, by the preference they might feel
      to another, to reject the one proposed; because they could not
      assure themselves, that the person they might wish would be
      brought forward by a second or by any subsequent nomination. They
      could not even be certain, that a future nomination would present
      a candidate in any degree more acceptable to them; and as their
      dissent might cast a kind of stigma upon the individual rejected,
      and might have the appearance of a reflection upon the judgment of
      the chief magistrate, it is not likely that their sanction would
      often be refused, where there were not special and strong reasons
      for the refusal. <a class="permalink" href="#p8">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p9">To what purpose then require the co-operation of the
      Senate? I answer, that the necessity of their concurrence would
      have a powerful, though, in general, a silent operation. It would
      be an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in the
      President, and would tend greatly to prevent the appointment of
      unfit characters from State prejudice, from family connection,
      from personal attachment, or from a view to popularity. In
      addition to this, it would be an efficacious source of stability
      in the administration. <a class="permalink" href="#p9">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p10">It will readily be comprehended, that a man who had
      himself the sole disposition of offices, would be governed much
      more by his private inclinations and interests, than when he was
      bound to submit the propriety of his choice to the discussion and
      determination of a different and independent body, and that body
      an entier branch of the legislature. The possibility of rejection
      would be a strong motive to care in proposing. The danger to his
      own reputation, and, in the case of an elective magistrate, to his
      political existence, from betraying a spirit of favoritism, or an
      unbecoming pursuit of popularity, to the observation of a body
      whose opinion would have great weight in forming that of the
      public, could not fail to operate as a barrier to the one and to
      the other. He would be both ashamed and afraid to bring forward,
      for the most distinguished or lucrative stations, candidates who
      had no other merit than that of coming from the same State to
      which he particularly belonged, or of being in some way or other
      personally allied to him, or of possessing the necessary
      insignificance and pliancy to render them the obsequious
      instruments of his pleasure. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p10">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p11">To this reasoning it has been objected that the
      President, by the influence of the power of nomination, may secure
      the complaisance of the Senate to his views. This supposition of
      universal venalty in human nature is little less an error in
      political reasoning, than the supposition of universal rectitude.
      The institution of delegated power implies, that there is a
      portion of virtue and honor among mankind, which may be a
      reasonable foundation of confidence; and experience justifies the
      theory. It has been found to exist in the most corrupt periods of
      the most corrupt governments. The venalty of the British House of
      Commons has been long a topic of accusation against that body, in
      the country to which they belong as well as in this; and it cannot
      be doubted that the charge is, to a considerable extent, well
      founded. But it is as little to be doubted, that there is always a
      large proportion of the body, which consists of independent and
      public-spirited men, who have an influential weight in the
      councils of the nation. Hence it is (the present reign not
      excepted) that the sense of that body is often seen to control the
      inclinations of the monarch, both with regard to men and to
      measures. Though it might therefore be allowable to suppose that
      the Executive might occasionally influence some individuals in the
      Senate, yet the supposition, that he could in general purchase the
      integrity of the whole body, would be forced and improbable. A man
      disposed to view human nature as it is, without either flattering
      its virtues or exaggerating its vices, will see sufficient ground
      of confidence in the probity of the Senate, to rest satisfied, not
      only that it will be impracticable to the Executive to corrupt or
      seduce a majority of its members, but that the necessity of its
      co-operation, in the business of appointments, will be a
      considerable and salutary restraint upon the conduct of that
      magistrate. Nor is the integrity of the Senate the only reliance.
      The Constitution has provided some important guards against the
      danger of executive influence upon the legislative body: it <a
      href="constitution#a1s6c2">declares</a> that <q
      cite="constitution#a1s6c2">No senator or representative shall
      during the time <em>for which he was elected</em>, be appointed to
      any civil office under the United States, which shall have been
      created, or the emoluments whereof shall have been increased,
      during such time; and no person, holding any office under the
      United States, shall be a member of either house during his
      continuance in office.</q> <a class="permalink"
