      Method of Guarding Against the Encroachments of Any One Department
      of Government by Appealing to the People Through a Convention
    </h2>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><span class="initial">The</span> author of the
      &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia,&quot; quoted in the last
      paper, has subjoined to that valuable work the draught of a
      constitution, which had been prepared in order to be laid before a
      convention, expected to be called in 1783, by the legislature, for
      the establishment of a constitution for that commonwealth. The
      plan, like every thing from the same pen, marks a turn of
      thinking, original, comprehensive, and accurate; and is the more
      worthy of attention as it equally displays a fervent attachment to
      republican government and an enlightened view of the dangerous
      propensities against which it ought to be guarded. One of the
      precautions which he proposes, and on which he appears ultimately
      to rely as a palladium to the weaker departments of power against
      the invasions of the stronger, is perhaps altogether his own, and
      as it immediately relates to the subject of our present inquiry,
      ought not to be overlooked. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">His proposition is, <q>that whenever any two of the
      three branches of government shall concur in opinion, each by the
      voices of two thirds of their whole number, that a convention is
      necessary for altering the constitution, or <em>correcting
      breaches of it</em>, a convention shall be called for the
      purpose.</q> <a class="permalink" href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">As the people are the only legitimate fountain of
      power, and it is from them that the constitutional charter, under
      which the several branches of government hold their power, is
      derived, it seems strictly consonant to the republican theory, to
      recur to the same original authority, not only whenever it may be
      necessary to enlarge, diminish, or new-model the powers of the
      government, but also whenever any one of the departments may
      commit encroachments on the chartered authorities of the others.
      The several departments being perfectly co-ordinate by the terms
      of their common commission, none of them, it is evident, can
      pretend to an exclusive or superior right of settling the
      boundaries between their respective powers; and how are the
      encroachments of the stronger to be prevented, or the wrongs of
      the weaker to be redressed, without an appeal to the people
      themselves, who, as the grantors of the commissions, can alone
      declare its true meaning, and enforce its observance? <a
      class="permalink" href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">There is certainly great force in this reasoning, and
      it must be allowed to prove that a constitutional road to the
      decision of the people ought to be marked out and kept open, for
      certain great and extraordinary occasions. But there appear to be
      insuperable objections against the proposed recurrence to the
      people, as a provision in all cases for keeping the several
      departments of power within their constitutional limits. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">In the first place, the provision does not reach the
      case of a combination of two of the departments against the third.
      If the legislative authority, which possesses so many means of
      operating on the motives of the other departments, should be able
      to gain to its interest either of the others, or even one third of
      its members, the remaining department could derive no advantage
      from its remedial provision. I do not dwell, however, on this
      objection, because it may be thought to be rather against the
      modification of the principle, than against the principle itself.
      <a class="permalink" href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">In the next place, it may be considered as an objection
      inherent in the principle, that as every appeal to the people
      would carry an implication of some defect in the government,
      frequent appeals would, in a great measure, deprive the government
      of that veneration which time bestows on every thing, and without
      which perhaps the wisest and freest governments would not possess
      the requisite stability. If it be true that all governments rest
      on opinion, it is no less true that the strength of opinion in
      each individual, and its practical influence on his conduct,
      depend much on the number which he supposes to have entertained
      the same opinion. The reason of man, like man himself, is timid
      and cautious when left alone, and acquires firmness and confidence
      in proportion to the number with which it is associated. When the
      examples which fortify opinion are <em>ancient</em> as well as
      <em>numerous</em>, they are known to have a double effect. In a
      nation of philosophers, this consideration ought to be
      disregarded. A reverence for the laws would be sufficiently
      inculcated by the voice of an enlightened reason. But a nation of
      philosophers is as little to be expected as the philosophical race
      of kings wished for by Plato. And in every other nation, the most
      rational government will not find it a superfluous advantage to
      have the prejudices of the community on its side. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p7">The danger of disturbing the public tranquillity by
      interesting too strongly the public passions, is a still more
      serious objection against a frequent reference of constitutional
      questions to the decision of the whole society. Notwithstanding
      the success which has attended the revisions of our established
      forms of government, and which does so much honor to the virtue
      and intelligence of the people of America, it must be confessed
      that the experiments are of too ticklish a nature to be
      unnecessarily multiplied. We are to recollect that all the
      existing constitutions were formed in the midst of a danger which
      repressed the passions most unfriendly to order and concord; of an
      enthusiastic confidence of the people in their patriotic leaders,
      which stifled the ordinary diversity of opinions on great national
      questions; of a universal ardor for new and opposite forms,
      produced by a universal resentment and indignation against the
      ancient government; and whilst no spirit of party connected with
      the changes to be made, or the abuses to be reformed, could mingle
      its leaven in the operation. The future situations in which we
      must expect to be usually placed, do not present any equivalent
      security against the danger which is apprehended. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p8">But the greatest objection of all is, that the
      decisions which would probably result from such appeals would not
      answer the purpose of maintaining the constitutional equilibrium
      of the government. We have seen that the tendency of republican
      governments is to an aggrandizement of the legislative at the
      expense of the other departments. The appeals to the people,
      therefore, would usually be made by the executive and judiciary
      departments. But whether made by one side or the other, would each
      side enjoy equal advantages on the trial? Let us view their
      different situations. The members of the executive and judiciary
      departments are few in number, and can be personally known to a
      small part only of the people. The latter, by the mode of their
      appointment, as well as by the nature and permanency of it, are
      too far removed from the people to share much in their
      prepossessions. The former are generally the objects of jealousy,
      and their administration is always liable to be discolored and
      rendered unpopular. The members of the legislative department, on
      the other hand, are numberous. They are distributed and dwell
      among the people at large. Their connections of blood, of
      friendship, and of acquaintance embrace a great proportion of the
      most influential part of the society. The nature of their public
      trust implies a personal influence among the people, and that they
      are more immediately the confidential guardians of the rights and
      liberties of the people. With these advantages, it can hardly be
      supposed that the adverse party would have an equal chance for a
      favorable issue. <a class="permalink" href="#p8">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p9">But the legislative party would not only be able to
      plead their cause most successfully with the people. They would
      probably be constituted themselves the judges. The same influence
      which had gained them an election into the legislature, would gain
      them a seat in the convention. If this should not be the case with
      all, it would probably be the case with many, and pretty certainly
      with those leading characters, on whom every thing depends in such
      bodies. The convention, in short, would be composed chiefly of men
      who had been, who actually were, or who expected to be, members of
      the department whose conduct was arraigned. They would
      consequently be parties to the very question to be decided by
      them. <a class="permalink" href="#p9">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p10">It might, however, sometimes happen, that appeals
      would be made under circumstances less adverse to the executive
      and judiciary departments. The usurpations of the legislature
      might be so flagrant and so sudden, as to admit of no specious
      coloring. A strong party among themselves might take side with the
      other branches. The executive power might be in the hands of a
      peculiar favorite of the people. In such a posture of things, the
      public decision might be less swayed by prepossessions in favor of
      the legislative party. But still it could never be expected to
      turn on the true merits of the question. It would inevitably be
      connected with the spirit of pre-existing parties, or of parties
      springing out of the question itself. It would be connected with
      persons of distinguished character and extensive influence in the
      community. It would be pronounced by the very men who had been
      agents in, or opponents of, the measures to which the decision
      would relate. The <em>passions</em>, therefore, not the
      <em>reason</em>, of the public would sit in judgment. But it is
      the reason, alone, of the public, that ought to control and
      regulate the government. The passions ought to be controlled and
      regulated by the government. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p10">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p11">We found in the last paper, that mere declarations in
      the written constitution are not sufficient to restrain the
      several departments within their legal rights. It appears in this,
      that occasional appeals to the people would be neither a proper
      nor an effectual provision for that purpose. How far the
      provisions of a different nature contained in the plan above
      quoted might be adequate, I do not examine. Some of them are
      unquestionably founded on sound political principles, and all of
      them are framed with singular ingenuity and precision. <a
