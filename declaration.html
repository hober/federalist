    <h1 class="entry-title">The unanimous <a rel="bookmark"
    href="declaration">Declaration</a> <span class="minor">of the thirteen
    united</span> States of America</h1>

    <div class="entry-content">
    <p id="p1"><span class="initial">When</span> in the course of human
    Events, it becomes necessary for one People to dissolve the
    Political Bands which have connected them with another, and to
    assume among the Powers of the Earth, the separate and equal Station
    to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a
    decent Respect to the Opinions of Mankind requires that they should
    declare the causes which impel them to the Separation. <a
    class="permalink" href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p2">We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men
    are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with
    certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and
    the pursuit of Happiness. <a class="permalink" href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p3">That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted
    among Men, deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the
    Governed. <a class="permalink" href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p4">That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive
    of these Ends, it is in the Right of the People to alter or abolish
    it, and to institute a new Government, laying its Foundation on such
    Principles, and organizing its Powers in such Form, as to them shall
    seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence
    indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be
    changed for light and transient Causes; and accordingly all
    Experience hath shewn, that Mankind are more disposed to suffer,
    while Evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing
    the Forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long Train of
    Abuses and Usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object, evinces
    a Design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their Right,
    it is their Duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new
    Guards for their future Security. <a class="permalink"
    href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p5">Such has been the patient Sufferance of these Colonies;
    and such is now the Necessity which constrains them to alter their
    former Systems of Government. The History of the Present King of
    Great-Britain is a History of repeated Injuries and Usurpations, all
    having in direct Object the Establishment of an absolute Tyranny
    over these States. To prove this, let the Facts be submitted to a
    candid World. <a class="permalink" href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

    <ul id="grievances">
    <li id="p6">He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and
    necessary for the public Good. <a class="permalink"
    href="#p6">&#182;</a></li>

    <li id="p7">He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate
    and pressing Importance, unless suspended in their Operation till
    his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly
    neglected to attend to them. <a class="permalink"
    href="#p7">&#182;</a></li>

    <li id="p8">He has refused to pass other Laws for the Accommodation
    of large Districts of People; unless those People would relinquish
    the Right of Representation in the Legislature, a Right inestimable
    to them, and formidable to Tyrants only. <a class="permalink"
    href="#p8">&#182;</a></li>

    <li id="p9">He has called together Legislative Bodies at Places
    unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the Depository of their
    public Records, for the sole Purpose of fatiguing them into
    Compliance with his Measures. <a class="permalink"
    href="#p9">&#182;</a></li>

    <li id="p10">He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for
    opposing with manly Firmness his Invasions on the Rights of the
    People. <a class="permalink" href="#p10">&#182;</a></li>

    <li id="p11">He has refused for a long Time, after such Dissolutions,
    to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative Powers,
    incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for
    their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all
    the Dangers of Invasion from without, and Convulsions within. <a
    class="permalink" href="#p11">&#182;</a></li>

    <li id="p12">He has endeavoured to prevent the Population of these
    States; for that Purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of
    Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their Migrations
    hither, and raising the Conditions of new Appropriations of
    Lands. <a class="permalink" href="#p12">&#182;</a></li>

    <li id="p13">He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by
    refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers. <a
    class="permalink" href="#p13">&#182;</a></li>

    <li id="p14">He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the
    Tenure of their Offices, and Amount and Payment of their Salaries.
    <a class="permalink" href="#p14">&#182;</a></li>

    <li id="p15">He has erected a Multitude of new Offices, and sent
    hither Swarms of Officers to harass our People, and eat out their
    Substance. <a class="permalink" href="#p15">&#182;</a></li>

    <li id="p16">He has kept among us, in Times of Peace, Standing
    Armies, without the consent of our Legislature. <a
    class="permalink" href="#p16">&#182;</a></li>

    <li id="p17">He has affected to render the Military independent of
    and superior to the Civil Power. <a class="permalink"
    href="#p17">&#182;</a></li>

    <li id="p18">He has combined with others to subject us to a
    Jurisdiction foreign to our Constitution, and unacknowledged by our
    Laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislaton: <a
    class="permalink" href="#p18">&#182;</a></li>

    <li id="p19">For quartering large Bodies of Armed Troops among us: <a
    class="permalink" href="#p19">&#182;</a></li>

    <li id="p20">For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from Punishment
    for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these
    States: <a class="permalink" href="#p20">&#182;</a></li>

    <li id="p21">For cutting off our Trade with all Parts of the World:
    <a class="permalink" href="#p21">&#182;</a></li>

    <li id="p22">For imposing taxes on us without our Consent: <a
    class="permalink" href="#p22">&#182;</a></li>

    <li id="p23">For depriving us, in many Cases, of the Benefits of
    Trial by Jury: <a class="permalink" href="#p23">&#182;</a></li>

    <li id="p24">For transporting us beyond the Seas to be tried for
    pretended Offences: <a class="permalink" href="#p24">&#182;</a></li>

    <li id="p25">For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a
    neighbouring Province, establishing therein an arbitrary Government,
    and enlarging its Boundaries, so as to render it at once an Example
    and fit Instrument for introducing the same absolute Rule in these
    Colonies: <a class="permalink" href="#p25">&#182;</a></li>

    <li id="p26">For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most
    valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our
    Governments: <a class="permalink" href="#p26">&#182;</a></li>

    <li id="p27">For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring
    themselves invested with Powers to legislate for us in all Cases
    whatsoever. <a class="permalink" href="#p27">&#182;</a></li>

    <li id="p28">He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of
    his Protection and waging War against us. <a class="permalink"
    href="#p28">&#182;</a></li>

    <li id="p29">He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our
    Towns, and destroyed the Lives of our People. <a class="permalink"
    href="#p29">&#182;</a></li>

    <li id="p30">He is, at this Time, transporting large Armies of
    foreign Mercenaries to complete the Works of Death, Desolation, and
    Tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty and Perfidy,
    scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous Ages, and totally unworthy
    the Head of a civilized Nation. <a class="permalink"
    href="#p30">&#182;</a></li>

    <li id="p31">He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on
    the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the
    Executioners of their Friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by
    their Hands. <a class="permalink" href="#p31">&#182;</a></li>

    <li id="p32">He has excited domestic Insurrections among us, and has
    endeavoured to bring on the Inhabitants of our Frontiers, the
    merciless Indian Savages, whose known Rule of Warfare, is an
    undistinguished Destruction, of all Ages, Sexes and Conditions. <a
    class="permalink" href="#p32">&#182;</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p id="p33">In every stage of these Oppressions we have Petitioned
    for Redress in the most humble Terms: Our repeated Petitions have
    been answered only by repeated Injury. A Prince, whose Character is
    thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be
    the Ruler of a free People. <a class="permalink" href="#p33">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p34">Nor have we been wanting in Attentions to our British
    Brethren. We have warned them from Time to Time of Attempts by their
    Legislature to extend an unwarrantable Jurisdiction over us. We have
    reminded them of the Circumstances of our Emigration and Settlement
    here. We have appealed to their native Justice and Magnanimity, and
    we have conjured them by the Ties of our common Kindred to disavow
    these Usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our Connections
    and Correspondence. They too have been deaf to the Voice of Justice
    and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the
    Necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold
    the rest of Mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace, Friends. <a
    class="permalink" href="#p34">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="p35"><em>We, therefore</em>, the
    Representatives of the <em>united States of America</em>, in General
    Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the World for
    the Rectitude of our Intentions, do, in the Name, and by the
    Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly Publish and
    Declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be,
    <em>Free and Independent States</em>; that they are absolved from all
    Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political Connection
    between them and the State of Great-Britain, is and ought to be
    totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they
    have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances,
    establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which
    Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this
    Declaration, with a firm Reliance on the Protection of the divine
    Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our
    Fortunes, and our sacred Honor. <a class="permalink"
