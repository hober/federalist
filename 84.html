      Certain General and Miscellaneous Objections to the Constitution
      Considered and Answered
    </h2>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><span class="initial">In the</span> course of the
      foregoing review of the Constitution, I have taken notice of, and
      endeavored to answer most of the objections which have appeared
      against it. There, however, remain a few which either did not fall
      naturally under any particular head or were forgotten in their
      proper places. These shall now be discussed; but as the subject
      has been drawn into great length, I shall so far consult brevity
      as to comprise all my observations on these miscellaneous points
      in a single paper. <a class="permalink" href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">The most considerable of the remaining objections is
      that the plan of the convention contains no bill of rights. Among
      other answers given to this, it has been upon different occasions
      remarked that the constitutions of several of the States are in a
      similar predicament. I add that New York is of the number. And yet
      the opposers of the new system, in this State, who profess an
      unlimited admiration for its constitution, are among the most
      intemperate partisans of a bill of rights. To justify their zeal
      in this matter, they allege two things: one is that, though the
      constitution of New York has no bill of rights prefixed to it, yet
      it contains, in the body of it, various provisions in favor of
      particular privileges and rights, which, in substance amount to
      the same thing; the other is, that the Constitution adopts, in
      their full extent, the common and statute law of Great Britain, by
      which many other rights, not expressed in it, are equally secured.
      <a class="permalink" href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">To the first I answer, that the Constitution proposed
      by the convention contains, as well as the constitution of this
      State, a number of such provisions. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">Independent of those which relate to the structure of
      the government, we find the following: <a
      href="constitution#a1s3c7">Article 1, section 3, clause 7</a> <q
      cite="constitution#a1s3c7">Judgment in cases of impeachment shall
      not extend further than to removal from office, and
      disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or
      profit under the United States; but the party convicted shall,
      nevertheless, be liable and subject to indictment, trial,
      judgment, and punishment according to law.</q> <a
      href="constitution#a1s9c2">Section 9, of the same article, clause
      2</a> <q cite="constitution#a1s9c2">The privilege of the writ of
      habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of
      rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it.</q> <a
      href="constitution#a1s9c3">Clause 3</a> <q
      cite="constitution#a1s9c3">No bill of attainder or ex-post-facto
      law shall be passed.</q> <a href="constitution#a1s9c7">Clause
      7</a> <q cite="constitution#a1s9c7">No title of nobility shall be
      granted by the United States; and no person holding any office of
      profit or trust under them, shall, without the consent of the
      Congress, accept of any present, emolument, office, or title of
      any kind whatever, from any king, prince, or foreign state.</q> <a
      href="constitution#a3s2c3">Article 3, section 2, clause 3</a> <q
      cite="constitution#a3s2c3">The trial of all crimes, except in
      cases of impeachment, shall be by jury; and such trial shall be
      held in the State where the said crimes shall have been committed;
      but when not committed within any State, the trial shall be at
      such place or places as the Congress may by law have directed.</q>
      <a href="constitution#a3s3">Section 3, of the same article</a> <q
      cite="constitution#a3s3">Treason against the United States shall
      consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their
      enemies, giving them aid and comfort. No person shall be convicted
      of treason, unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same
      overt act, or on confession in open court.</q> And <a
      href="constitution#a3s3c3">clause 3, of the same section</a> <q
      cite="constitution#a3s3c3">The Congress shall have power to
      declare the punishment of treason; but no attainder of treason
      shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture, except during the
      life of the person attainted.</q> It may well be a question,
      whether these are not, upon the whole, of equal importance with
      any which are to be found in the constitution of this State. The
      establishment of the writ of habeas corpus, the prohibition of
      ex-post-facto laws, and of <em>titles of nobility, to which we
      have no corresponding provision in our constitution</em>, are
      perhaps greater securities to liberty and republicanism than any
      it contains. The creation of crimes after the commission of the
      fact, or, in other words, the subjecting of men to punishment for
      things which, when they were done, were breaches of no law, and
      the practice of arbitrary imprisonments, have been, in all ages,
      the favorite and most formidable instruments of tyranny. The
      observations of the judicious Blackstone,<a class="note"
      href="#note1">1</a> in reference to the latter, are well worthy of
      recital: <q>To bereave a man of life, [says he] or by violence to
      confiscate his estate, without accusation or trial, would be so
      gross and notorious an act of despotism, as must at once convey
      the alarm of tyranny throughout the whole nation; but confinement
      of the person, by secretly hurrying him to jail, where his
      sufferings are unknown or forgotten, is a less public, a less
      striking, and therefore <em>a more dangerous engine</em> of
      arbitrary government.</q> And as a remedy for this fatal evil he
      is everywhere peculiarly emphatical in his encomiums on the
      habeas-corpus act, which in one place he calls <q>the
      <em>bulwark</em> of the British Constitution.</q><a class="note"
      href="#note2">2</a> <a class="permalink" href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">Nothing need be said to illustrate the importance of
      the prohibition of titles of nobility. This may truly be
      denominated the corner-stone of republican government; for so long
      as they are excluded, there can never be serious danger that the
      government will be any other than that of the people. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">To the second that is, to the pretended establishment
      of the common and state law by the Constitution, I answer, that
      they are expressly made subject <q>to such alterations and
      provisions as the legislature shall from time to time make
      concerning the same.</q> They are therefore at any moment liable
      to repeal by the ordinary legislative power, and of course have no
      constitutional sanction. The only use of the declaration was to
      recognize the ancient law and to remove doubts which might have
      been occasioned by the Revolution. This consequently can be
      considered as no part of a declaration of rights, which under our
      constitutions must be intended as limitations of the power of the
      government itself. <a class="permalink" href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p7">It has been several times truly remarked that bills of
      rights are, in their origin, stipulations between kings and their
      subjects, abridgements of prerogative in favor of privilege,
      reservations of rights not surrendered to the prince. Such was
      <em>Magna Charta</em>, obtained by the barons, sword in hand, from
      King John. Such were the subsequent confirmations of that charter
      by succeeding princes. Such was the <em>Petition of Right</em>
      assented to by Charles I., in the beginning of his reign. Such,
      also, was the Declaration of Right presented by the Lords and
      Commons to the Prince of Orange in 1688, and afterwards thrown
      into the form of an act of parliament called the Bill of Rights.
      It is evident, therefore, that, according to their primitive
      signification, they have no application to constitutions
      professedly founded upon the power of the people, and executed by
      their immediate representatives and servants. Here, in strictness,
      the people surrender nothing; and as they retain every thing they
      have no need of particular reservations. <q
      cite="constitution#preamble"><em>We, the People</em> of the United
      States, to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our
      posterity, do <em>ordain</em> and <em>establish</em> this
      Constitution for the United States of America.</q> Here is a
      better recognition of popular rights, than volumes of those
      aphorisms which make the principal figure in several of our State
      bills of rights, and which would sound much better in a treatise
      of ethics than in a constitution of government. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p8">But a minute detail of particular rights is certainly
      far less applicable to a Constitution like that under
      consideration, which is merely intended to regulate the general
      political interests of the nation, than to a constitution which
      has the regulation of every species of personal and private
      concerns. If, therefore, the loud clamors against the plan of the
      convention, on this score, are well founded, no epithets of
      reprobation will be too strong for the constitution of this State.
      But the truth is, that both of them contain all which, in relation
      to their objects, is reasonably to be desired. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p8">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p9">I go further, and affirm that bills of rights, in the
      sense and to the extent in which they are contended for, are not
      only unnecessary in the proposed Constitution, but would even be
      dangerous. They would contain various exceptions to powers not
      granted; and, on this very account, would afford a colorable
      pretext to claim more than were granted. For why declare that
      things shall not be done which there is no power to do? Why, for
      instance, should it be said that the liberty of the press shall
      not be restrained, when no power is given by which restrictions
      may be imposed? I will not contend that such a provision would
      confer a regulating power; but it is evident that it would
      furnish, to men disposed to usurp, a plausible pretense for
      claiming that power. They might urge with a semblance of reason,
      that the Constitution ought not to be charged with the absurdity
      of providing against the abuse of an authority which was not
      given, and that the provision against restraining the liberty of
      the press afforded a clear implication, that a power to prescribe
      proper regulations concerning it was intended to be vested in the
      national government. This may serve as a specimen of the numerous
      handles which would be given to the doctrine of constructive
      powers, by the indulgence of an injudicious zeal for bills of
      rights. <a class="permalink" href="#p9">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p10">On the subject of the liberty of the press, as much as
      has been said, I cannot forbear adding a remark or two: in the
      first place, I observe, that there is not a syllable concerning it
      in the constitution of this State; in the next, I contend, that
      whatever has been said about it in that of any other State,
      amounts to nothing. What signifies a declaration, that <q>the
      liberty of the press shall be inviolably preserved</q>? What is
      the liberty of the press? Who can give it any definition which
      would not leave the utmost latitude for evasion? I hold it to be
      impracticable; and from this I infer, that its security, whatever
      fine declarations may be inserted in any constitution respecting
      it, must altogether depend on public opinion, and on the general
      spirit of the people and of the government.<a class="note"
      href="#note3">3</a> And here, after all, as is intimated upon
      another occasion, must we seek for the only solid basis of all our
      rights. <a class="permalink" href="#p10">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p11">There remains but one other view of this matter to
      conclude the point. The truth is, after all the declamations we
      have heard, that the Constitution is itself, in every rational
      sense, and to every useful purpose, <em>a bill of rights</em>. The
      several bills of rights in Great Britain form its Constitution,
      and conversely the constitution of each State is its bill of
      rights. And the proposed Constitution, if adopted, will be the
      bill of rights of the Union. Is it one object of a bill of rights
      to declare and specify the political privileges of the citizens in
      the structure and administration of the government? This is done
      in the most ample and precise manner in the plan of the
      convention; comprehending various precautions for the public
      security, which are not to be found in any of the State
      constitutions. Is another object of a bill of rights to define
      certain immunities and modes of proceeding, which are relative to
      personal and private concerns? This we have seen has also been
      attended to, in a variety of cases, in the same plan. Adverting
      therefore to the substantial meaning of a bill of rights, it is
      absurd to allege that it is not to be found in the work of the
      convention. It may be said that it does not go far enough, though
      it will not be easy to make this appear; but it can with no
      propriety be contended that there is no such thing. It certainly
      must be immaterial what mode is observed as to the order of
      declaring the rights of the citizens, if they are to be found in
      any part of the instrument which establishes the government. And
      hence it must be apparent, that much of what has been said on this
      subject rests merely on verbal and nominal distinctions, entirely
      foreign from the substance of the thing. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p11">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p12">Another objection which has been made, and which, from
      the frequency of its repetition, it is to be presumed is relied
      on, is of this nature: <q>It is improper Usay the objectorse to
      confer such large powers, as are proposed, upon the national
      government, because the seat of that government must of necessity
      be too remote from many of the States to admit of a proper
      knowledge on the part of the constituent, of the conduct of the
      representative body.</q> This argument, if it proves any thing,
      proves that there ought to be no general government whatever. For
      the powers which, it seems to be agreed on all hands, ought to be
      vested in the Union, cannot be safely intrusted to a body which is
      not under every requisite control. But there are satisfactory
      reasons to show that the objection is in reality not well founded.
      There is in most of the arguments which relate to distance a
      palpable illusion of the imagination. What are the sources of
      information by which the people in Montgomery County must regulate
      their judgment of the conduct of their representatives in the
      State legislature? Of personal observation they can have no
      benefit. This is confined to the citizens on the spot. They must
      therefore depend on the information of intelligent men, in whom
      they confide; and how must these men obtain their information?
      Evidently from the complexion of public measures, from the public
      prints, from correspondences with theirrepresentatives, and with
      other persons who reside at the place of their deliberations. This
      does not apply to Montgomery County only, but to all the counties
      at any considerable distance from the seat of government. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p12">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p13">It is equally evident that the same sources of
      information would be open to the people in relation to the conduct
      of their representatives in the general government, and the
      impediments to a prompt communication which distance may be
      supposed to create, will be overbalanced by the effects of the
      vigilance of the State governments. The executive and legislative
      bodies of each State will be so many sentinels over the persons
      employed in every department of the national administration; and
      as it will be in their power to adopt and pursue a regular and
      effectual system of intelligence, they can never be at a loss to
      know the behavior of those who represent their constituents in the
      national councils, and can readily communicate the same knowledge
      to the people. Their disposition to apprise the community of
      whatever may prejudice its interests from another quarter, may be
      relied upon, if it were only from the rivalship of power. And we
      may conclude with the fullest assurance that the people, through
      that channel, will be better informed of the conduct of their
      national representatives, than they can be by any means they now
      possess of that of their State representatives. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p13">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p14">It ought also to be remembered that the citizens who
      inhabit the country at and near the seat of government will, in
      all questions that affect the general liberty and prosperity, have
      the same interest with those who are at a distance, and that they
      will stand ready to sound the alarm when necessary, and to point
      out the actors in any pernicious project. The public papers will
      be expeditious messengers of intelligence to the most remote
      inhabitants of the Union. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p14">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p15">Among the many curious objections which have appeared
      against the proposed Constitution, the most extraordinary and the
      least colorable is derived from the want of some provision
      respecting the debts due <em>to</em> the United States. This has
      been represented as a tacit relinquishment of those debts, and as
      a wicked contrivance to screen public defaulters. The newspapers
      have teemed with the most inflammatory railings on this head; yet
      there is nothing clearer than that the suggestion is entirely void
      of foundation, the offspring of extreme ignorance or extreme
      dishonesty. In addition to the remarks I have made upon the
      subject in another place, I shall only observe that as it is a
      plain dictate of common-sense, so it is also an established
      doctrine of political law, that <q><em>states neither lose any of
      their rights, nor are discharged from any of their obligations, by
      a change in the form of their civil government</em>.</q> <a
      class="note" href="#note4">4</a> The last objection of any
      consequence, which I at present recollect, turns upon the article
      of expense. If it were even true, that the adoption of the
      proposed government would occasion a considerable increase of
      expense, it would be an objection that ought to have no weight
      against the plan. <a class="permalink" href="#p15">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p16">The great bulk of the citizens of America are with
      reason convinced, that Union is the basis of their political
      happiness. Men of sense of all parties now, with few exceptions,
      agree that it cannot be preserved under the present system, nor
      without radical alterations; that new and extensive powers ought
      to be granted to the national head, and that these require a
      different organization of the federal government a single body
      being an unsafe depositary of such ample authorities. In conceding
      all this, the question of expense must be given up; for it is
      impossible, with any degree of safety, to narrow the foundation
      upon which the system is to stand. The two branches of the
      legislature are, in the first instance, to consist of only
      sixty-five persons, which is the same number of which Congress,
      under the existing Confederation, may be composed. It is true that
      this number is intended to be increased; but this is to keep pace
      with the progress of the population and resources of the country.
      It is evident that a less number would, even in the first
      instance, have been unsafe, and that a continuance of the present
      number would, in a more advanced stage of population, be a very
      inadequate representation of the people. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p16">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p17">Whence is the dreaded augmentation of expense to
      spring? One source indicated, is the multiplication of offices
      under the new government. Let us examine this a little. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p17">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p18">It is evident that the principal departments of the
      administration under the present government, are the same which
      will be required under the new. There are now a Secretary of War,
      a Secretary of Foreign Affairs, a Secretary for Domestic Affairs,
      a Board of Treasury, consisting of three persons, a Treasurer,
      assistants, clerks, etc. These officers are indispensable under
      any system, and will suffice under the new as well as the old. As
      to ambassadors and other ministers and agents in foreign
      countries, the proposed Constitution can make no other difference
      than to render their characters, where they reside, more
      respectable, and their services more useful. As to persons to be
      employed in the collection of the revenues, it is unquestionably
      true that these will form a very considerable addition to the
      number of federal officers; but it will not follow that this will
      occasion an increase of public expense. It will be in most cases
      nothing more than an exchange of State for national officers. In
      the collection of all duties, for instance, the persons employed
      will be wholly of the latter description. The States individually
      will stand in no need of any for this purpose. What difference can
      it make in point of expense to pay officers of the customs
      appointed by the State or by the United States? There is no good
      reason to suppose that either the number or the salaries of the
      latter will be greater than those of the former. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p18">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p19">Where then are we to seek for those additional
      articles of expense which are to swell the account to the enormous
      size that has been represented to us? The chief item which occurs
      to me respects the support of the judges of the United States. I
      do not add the President, because there is now a president of
      Congress, whose expenses may not be far, if any thing, short of
      those which will be incurred on account of the President of the
      United States. The support of the judges will clearly be an extra
      expense, but to what extent will depend on the particular plan
      which may be adopted in regard to this matter. But upon no
      reasonable plan can it amount to a sum which will be an object of
      material consequence. <a class="permalink" href="#p19">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p20">Let us now see what there is to counterbalance any
      extra expense that may attend the establishment of the proposed
      government. The first thing which presents itself is that a great
      part of the business which now keeps Congress sitting through the
      year will be transacted by the President. Even the management of
      foreign negotiations will naturally devolve upon him, according to
      general principles concerted with the Senate, and subject to their
      final concurrence. Hence it is evident that a portion of the year
      will suffice for the session of both the Senate and the House of
      Representatives; we may suppose about a fourth for the latter and
      a third, or perhaps half, for the former. The extra business of
      treaties and appointments may give this extra occupation to the
      Senate. From this circumstance we may infer that, until the House
      of Representatives shall be increased greatly beyond its present
      number, there will be a considerable saving of expense from the
      difference between the constant session of the present and the
      temporary session of the future Congress. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p20">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p21">But there is another circumstance of great importance
      in the view of economy. The business of the United States has
      hitherto occupied the State legislatures, as well as Congress. The
      latter has made requisitions which the former have had to provide
      for. Hence it has happened that the sessions of the State
      legislatures have been protracted greatly beyond what was
      necessary for the execution of the mere local business of the
      States. More than half their time has been frequently employed in
      matters which related to the United States. Now the members who
      compose the legislatures of the several States amount to two
      thousand and upwards, which number has hitherto performed what
      under the new system will be done in the first instance by
      sixty-five persons, and probably at no future period by above a
      fourth or fifth of that number. The Congress under the proposed
      government will do all the business of the United States
      themselves, without the intervention of the State legislatures,
      who thenceforth will have only to attend to the affairs of their
      particular States, and will not have to sit in any proportion as
      long as they have heretofore done. This difference in the time of
      the sessions of the State legislatures will be clear gain, and
      will alone form an article of saving, which may be regarded as an
      equivalent for any additional objects of expense that may be
      occasioned by the adoption of the new system. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p21">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p22">The result from these observations is that the sources
      of additional expense from the establishment of the proposed
      Constitution are much fewer than may have been imagined; that they
      are counterbalanced by considerable objects of saving; and that
      while it is questionable on which side the scale will
      preponderate, it is certain that a government less expensive would
      be incompetent to the purposes of the Union. <a class="permalink"

          To show that there is a power in the Constitution by which the
          liberty of the press may be affected, recourse has been had to
          the power of taxation. It is said that duties may be laid upon
          the publications so high as to amount to a prohibition. I know
          not by what logic it could be maintained, that the
          declarations in the State constitutions, in favor of the
          freedom of the press, would be a constitutional impediment to
          the imposition of duties upon publications by the State
          legislatures. It cannot certainly be pretended that any degree
          of duties, however low, would be an abridgment of the liberty
          of the press. We know that newspapers are taxed in Great
          Britain, and yet it is notorious that the press nowhere enjoys
          greater liberty than in that country. And if duties of any
          kind may be laid without a violation of that liberty, it is
          evident that the extent must depend on legislative discretion,
          respecting the liberty of the press, will give it no greater
          security than it will have without them. The same invasions of
          it may be effected under the State constitutions which contain
          those declarations through the means of taxation, as under the
          proposed Constitution, which has nothing of the kind. It would
          be quite as significant to declare that government ought to be
          free, that taxes ought not to be excessive, etc., as that the
          liberty of the press ought not to be restrained.
