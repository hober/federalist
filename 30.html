    <h2 class="entry-summary">Concerning the General Power of Taxation</h2>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><span class="initial">It has</span> been already
      observed that the federal government ought to possess the power of
      providing for the support of the national forces; in which
      proposition was intended to be included the expense of raising
      troops, of building and equipping fleets, and all other expenses
      in any wise connected with military arrangements and operations.
      But these are not the only objects to which the jurisdiction of
      the Union, in respect to revenue, must necessarily be empowered to
      extend. It must embrace a provision for the support of the
      national civil list; for the payment of the national debts
      contracted, or that may be contracted; and, in general, for all
      those matters which will call for disbursements out of the
      national treasury. The conclusion is, that there must be
      interwoven, in the frame of the government, a general power of
      taxation, in one shape or another. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">Money is, with propriety, considered as the vital
      principle of the body politic; as that which sustains its life and
      motion, and enables it to perform its most essential functions. A
      complete power, therefore, to procure a regular and adequate
      supply of it, as far as the resources of the community will
      permit, may be regarded as an indispensable ingredient in every
      constitution. From a deficiency in this particular, one of two
      evils must ensue; either the people must be subjected to continual
      plunder, as a substitute for a more eligible mode of supplying the
      public wants, or the government must sink into a fatal atrophy,
      and, in a short course of time, perish. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">In the Ottoman or Turkish empire, the sovereign, though
      in other respects absolute master of the lives and fortunes of his
      subjects, has no right to impose a new tax. The consequence is
      that he permits the bashaws or governors of provinces to pillage
      the people without mercy; and, in turn, squeezes out of them the
      sums of which he stands in need, to satisfy his own exigencies and
      those of the state. In America, from a like cause, the government
      of the Union has gradually dwindled into a state of decay,
      approaching nearly to annihilation. Who can doubt, that the
      happiness of the people in both countries would be promoted by
      competent authorities in the proper hands, to provide the revenues
      which the necessities of the public might require? <a
      class="permalink" href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">The present Confederation, feeble as it is intended to
      repose in the United States, an unlimited power of providing for
      the pecuniary wants of the Union. But proceeding upon an erroneous
      principle, it has been done in such a manner as entirely to have
      frustrated the intention. Congress, by the articles which compose
      that compact (as has already been stated), are authorized to
      ascertain and call for any sums of money necessary, in their
      judgment, to the service of the United States; and their
      requisitions, if conformable to the rule of apportionment, are in
      every constitutional sense obligatory upon the States. These have
      no right to question the propriety of the demand; no discretion
      beyond that of devising the ways and means of furnishing the sums
      demanded. But though this be strictly and truly the case; though
      the assumption of such a right would be an infringement of the
      articles of Union; though it may seldom or never have been
      avowedly claimed, yet in practice it has been constantly
      exercised, and would continue to be so, as long as the revenues of
      the Confederacy should remain dependent on the intermediate agency
      of its members. What the consequences of this system have been, is
      within the knowledge of every man the least conversant in our
      public affairs, and has been amply unfolded in different parts of
      these inquiries. It is this which has chiefly contributed to
      reduce us to a situation, which affords ample cause both of
      mortification to ourselves, and of triumph to our enemies. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">What remedy can there be for this situation, but in a
      change of the system which has produced it in a change of the
      fallacious and delusive system of quotas and requisitions? What
      substitute can there be imagined for this ignis fatuus in finance,
      but that of permitting the national government to raise its own
      revenues by the ordinary methods of taxation authorized in every
      well-ordered constitution of civil government? Ingenious men may
      declaim with plausibility on any subject; but no human ingenuity
      can point out any other expedient to rescue us from the
      inconveniences and embarrassments naturally resulting from
      defective supplies of the public treasury. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">The more intelligent adversaries of the new
      Constitution admit the force of this reasoning; but they qualify
      their admission by a distinction between what they call
      <em>internal</em> and <em>external</em> taxation. The former they
      would reserve to the State governments; the latter, which they
      explain into commercial imposts, or rather duties on imported
      articles, they declare themselves willing to concede to the
      federal head. This distinction, however, would violate the maxim
      of good sense and sound policy, which dictates that every
      <em>power</em> ought to be in proportion to its <em>object</em>;
      and would still leave the general government in a kind of tutelage
      to the State governments, inconsistent with every idea of vigor or
      efficiency. Who can pretend that commercial imposts are, or would
      be, alone equal to the present and future exigencies of the Union?
      Taking into the account the existing debt, foreign and domestic,
      upon any plan of extinguishment which a man moderately impressed
      with the importance of public justice and public credit could
      approve, in addition to the establishments which all parties will
      acknowledge to be necessary, we could not reasonably flatter
      ourselves, that this resource alone, upon the most improved scale,
      would even suffice for its present necessities. Its future
      necessities admit not of calculation or limitation; and upon the
      principle, more than once adverted to, the power of making
      provision for them as they arise ought to be equally unconfined. I
      believe it may be regarded as a position warranted by the history
      of mankind, that, <em>in the usual progress of things, the
      necessities of a nation, in every stage of its existence, will be
      found at least equal to its resources</em>. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p7">To say that deficiencies may be provided for by
      requisitions upon the States, is on the one hand to acknowledge
      that this system cannot be depended upon, and on the other hand to
      depend upon it for every thing beyond a certain limit. Those who
      have carefully attended to its vices and deformities as they have
      been exhibited by experience or delineated in the course of these
      papers, must feel invincible repugnancy to trusting the national
      interests in any degree to its operation. Its inevitable tendency,
      whenever it is brought into activity, must be to enfeeble the
      Union, and sow the seeds of discord and contention between the
      federal head and its members, and between the members themselves.
      Can it be expected that the deficiencies would be better supplied
      in this mode than the total wants of the Union have heretofore
      been supplied in the same mode? It ought to be recollected that if
      less will be required from the States, they will have
      proportionably less means to answer the demand. If the opinions of
      those who contend for the distinction which has been mentioned
      were to be received as evidence of truth, one would be led to
      conclude that there was some known point in the economy of
      national affairs at which it would be safe to stop and to say:
      Thus far the ends of public happiness will be promoted by
      supplying the wants of government, and all beyond this is unworthy
      of our care or anxiety. How is it possible that a government half
      supplied and always necessitous, can fulfill the purposes of its
      institution, can provide for the security, advance the prosperity,
      or support the reputation of the commonwealth? How can it ever
      possess either energy or stability, dignity or credit, confidence
      at home or respectability abroad? How can its administration be
      any thing else than a succession of expedients temporizing,
      impotent, disgraceful? How will it be able to avoid a frequent
      sacrifice of its engagements to immediate necessity? How can it
      undertake or execute any liberal or enlarged plans of public good?
      <a class="permalink" href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p8">Let us attend to what would be the effects of this
      situation in the very first war in which we should happen to be
      engaged. We will presume, for argument's sake, that the revenue
      arising from the impost duties answers the purposes of a provision
      for the public debt and of a peace establishment for the Union.
      Thus circumstanced, a war breaks out. What would be the probable
      conduct of the government in such an emergency? Taught by
      experience that proper dependence could not be placed on the
      success of requisitions, unable by its own authority to lay hold
      of fresh resources, and urged by considerations of national
      danger, would it not be driven to the expedient of diverting the
      funds already appropriated from their proper objects to the
      defense of the State? It is not easy to see how a step of this
      kind could be avoided; and if it should be taken, it is evident
      that it would prove the destruction of public credit at the very
      moment that it was becoming essential to the public safety. To
      imagine that at such a crisis credit might be dispensed with,
      would be the extreme of infatuation. In the modern system of war,
      nations the most wealthy are obliged to have recourse to large
      loans. A country so little opulent as ours must feel this
      necessity in a much stronger degree. But who would lend to a
      government that prefaced its overtures for borrowing by an act
      which demonstrated that no reliance could be placed on the
      steadiness of its measures for paying? The loans it might be able
      to procure would be as limited in their extent as burdensome in
      their conditions. They would be made upon the same principles that
      usurers commonly lend to bankrupt and fraudulent debtors, with a
      sparing hand and at enormous premiums. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p8">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p9">It may perhaps be imagined that, from the scantiness of
      the resources of the country, the necessity of diverting the
      established funds in the case supposed would exist, though the
      national government should possess an unrestrained power of
      taxation. But two considerations will serve to quiet all
      apprehension on this head: one is, that we are sure the resources
      of the community, in their full extent, will be brought into
      activity for the benefit of the Union; the other is, that whatever
      deficiences there may be, can without difficulty be supplied by
      loans. <a class="permalink" href="#p9">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p10">The power of creating new funds upon new objects of
      taxation, by its own authority, would enable the national
      government to borrow as far as its necessities might require.
      Foreigners, as well as the citizens of America, could then
      reasonably repose confidence in its engagements; but to depend
      upon a government that must itself depend upon thirteen other
      governments for the means of fulfilling its contracts, when once
      its situation is clearly understood, would require a degree of
      credulity not often to be met with in the pecuniary transactions
      of mankind, and little reconcilable with the usual
      sharp-sightedness of avarice. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p10">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p11">Reflections of this kind may have trifling weight with
      men who hope to see realized in America the halcyon scenes of the
      poetic or fabulous age; but to those who believe we are likely to
      experience a common portion of the vicissitudes and calamities
      which have fallen to the lot of other nations, they must appear
      entitled to serious attention. Such men must behold the actual
      situation of their country with painful solicitude, and deprecate
      the evils which ambition or revenge might, with too much facility,
      inflict upon it. <a class="permalink" href="#p11">&#182;</a></p>
