      The Necessity of a Government as Energetic as the One Proposed to
      the Preservation of the Union
    </h2>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><span class="initial">The</span> necessity of a
      Constitution, at least equally energetic with the one proposed, to
      the preservation of the Union, is the point at the examination of
      which we are now arrived. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">This inquiry will naturally divide itself into three
      branches the objects to be provided for by the federal government,
      the quantity of power necessary to the accomplishment of those
      objects, the persons upon whom that power ought to operate. Its
      distribution and organization will more properly claim our
      attention under the succeeding head. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">The principal purposes to be answered by union are
      these the common defense of the members; the preservation of the
      public peace as well against internal convulsions as external
      attacks; the regulation of commerce with other nations and between
      the States; the superintendence of our intercourse, political and
      commercial, with foreign countries. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">The authorities essential to the common defense are
      these: to raise armies; to build and equip fleets; to prescribe
      rules for the government of both; to direct their operations; to
      provide for their support. These powers ought to exist without
      limitation, <em>because it is impossible to foresee or define the
      extent and variety of national exigencies, or the correspondent
      extent and variety of the means which may be necessary to satisfy
      them</em>. The circumstances that endanger the safety of nations
      are infinite, and for this reason no constitutional shackles can
      wisely be imposed on the power to which the care of it is
      committed. This power ought to be coextensive with all the
      possible combinations of such circumstances; and ought to be under
      the direction of the same councils which are appointed to preside
      over the common defense. <a class="permalink" href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">This is one of those truths which, to a correct and
      unprejudiced mind, carries its own evidence along with it; and may
      be obscured, but cannot be made plainer by argument or reasoning.
      It rests upon axioms as simple as they are universal; the
      <em>means</em> ought to be proportioned to the <em>end</em>; the
      persons, from whose agency the attainment of any <em>end</em> is
      expected, ought to possess the <em>means</em> by which it is to be
      attained. <a class="permalink" href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">Whether there ought to be a federal government
      intrusted with the care of the common defense, is a question in
      the first instance, open for discussion; but the moment it is
      decided in the affirmative, it will follow, that that government
      ought to be clothed with all the powers requisite to complete
      execution of its trust. And unless it can be shown that the
      circumstances which may affect the public safety are reducible
      within certain determinate limits; unless the contrary of this
      position can be fairly and rationally disputed, it must be
      admitted, as a necessary consequence, that there can be no
      limitation of that authority which is to provide for the defense
      and protection of the community, in any matter essential to its
      efficacy that is, in any matter essential to the <em>formation,
      direction</em>, or <em>support</em> of the <em>national
      forces</em>. <a class="permalink" href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p7">Defective as the present Confederation has been proved
      to be, this principle appears to have been fully recognized by the
      framers of it; though they have not made proper or adequate
      provision for its exercise. Congress have an unlimited discretion
      to make requisitions of men and money; to govern the army and
      navy; to direct their operations. As their requisitions are made
      constitutionally binding upon the States, who are in fact under
      the most solemn obligations to furnish the supplies required of
      them, the intention evidently was that the United States should
      command whatever resources were by them judged requisite to the
      "common defense and general welfare." It was presumed that a sense
      of their true interests, and a regard to the dictates of good
      faith, would be found sufficient pledges for the punctual
      performance of the duty of the members to the federal head. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p8">The experiment has, however, demonstrated that this
      expectation was ill-founded and illusory; and the observations,
      made under the last head, will, I imagine, have sufficed to
      convince the impartial and discerning, that there is an absolute
      necessity for an entire change in the first principles of the
      system; that if we are in earnest about giving the Union energy
      and duration, we must abandon the vain project of legislating upon
      the States in their collective capacities; we must extend the laws
      of the federal government to the individual citizens of America;
      we must discard the fallacious scheme of quotas and requisitions,
      as equally impracticable and unjust. The result from all this is
      that the Union ought to be invested with full power to levy
      troops; to build and equip fleets; and to raise the revenues which
      will be required for the formation and support of an army and
      navy, in the customary and ordinary modes practiced in other
      governments. <a class="permalink" href="#p8">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p9">If the circumstances of our country are such as to
      demand a compound instead of a simple, a confederate instead of a
      sole, government, the essential point which will remain to be
      adjusted will be to discriminate the <em>objects</em>, as far as
      it can be done, which shall appertain to the different provinces
      or departments of power; allowing to each the most ample authority
      for fulfilling the objects committed to its charge. Shall the
      Union be constituted the guardian of the common safety? Are fleets
      and armies and revenues necessary to this purpose? The government
      of the Union must be empowered to pass all laws, and to make all
      regulations which have relation to them. The same must be the case
      in respect to commerce, and to every other matter to which its
      jurisdiction is permitted to extend. Is the administration of
      justice between the citizens of the same State the proper
      department of the local governments? These must possess all the
      authorities which are connected with this object, and with every
      other that may be allotted to their particular cognizance and
      direction. Not to confer in each case a degree of power
      commensurate to the end, would be to violate the most obvious
      rules of prudence and propriety, and improvidently to trust the
      great interests of the nation to hands which are disabled from
      managing them with vigor and success. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p9">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p10">Who is likely to make suitable provisions for the
      public defense, as that body to which the guardianship of the
      public safety is confided; which, as the centre of information,
      will best understand the extent and urgency of the dangers that
      threaten; as the representative of the <em>whole</em>, will feel
      itself most deeply interested in the preservation of every part;
      which, from the responsibility implied in the duty assigned to it,
      will be most sensibly impressed with the necessity of proper
      exertions; and which, by the extension of its authority throughout
      the States, can alone establish uniformity and concert in the
      plans and measures by which the common safety is to be secured? Is
      there not a manifest inconsistency in devolving upon the federal
      government the care of the general defense, and leaving in the
      State governments the <em>effective</em> powers by which it is to
      be provided for? Is not a want of co-operation the infallible
      consequence of such a system? And will not weakness, disorder, an
      undue distribution of the burdens and calamities of war, an
      unnecessary and intolerable increase of expense, be its natural
      and inevitable concomitants? Have we not had unequivocal
      experience of its effects in the course of the revolution which we
      have just accomplished? <a class="permalink" href="#p10">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p11">Every view we may take of the subject, as candid
      inquirers after truth, will serve to convince us, that it is both
      unwise and dangerous to deny the federal government an unconfined
      authority, as to all those objects which are intrusted to its
      management. It will indeed deserve the most vigilant and careful
      attention of the people, to see that it be modeled in such a
      manner as to admit of its being safely vested with the requisite
      powers. If any plan which has been, or may be, offered to our
      consideration, should not, upon a dispassionate inspection, be
      found to answer this description, it ought to be rejected. A
      government, the constitution of which renders it unfit to be
      trusted with all the powers which a free people <em>ought to
      delegate to any government</em>, would be an unsafe and improper
      depositary of the <em>national interests</em>. Wherever
      <em>these</em> can with propriety be confided, the coincident
      powers may safely accompany them. This is the true result of all
      just reasoning upon the subject. And the adversaries of the plan
      promulgated by the convention ought to have confined themselves to
      showing, that the internal structure of the proposed government
      was such as to render it unworthy of the confidence of the people.
      They ought not to have wandered into inflammatory declamations and
      unmeaning cavils about the extent of the powers. The
      <em>powers</em> are not too extensive for the <em>objects</em> of
      federal administration, or, in other words, for the management of
      our <em>national interests</em>; nor can any satisfactory argument
      be framed to show that they are chargeable with such an excess. If
      it be true, as has been insinuated by some of the writers on the
      other side, that the difficulty arises from the nature of the
      thing, and that the extent of the country will not permit us to
      form a government in which such ample powers can safely be
      reposed, it would prove that we ought to contract our views, and
      resort to the expedient of separate confederacies, which will move
      within more practicable spheres. For the absurdity must
      continually stare us in the face of confiding to a government the
      direction of the most essential national interests, without daring
      to trust it to the authorities which are indispensible to their
      proper and efficient management. Let us not attempt to reconcile
      contradictions, but firmly embrace a rational alternative. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p11">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p12">I trust, however, that the impracticability of one
      general system cannot be shown. I am greatly mistaken, if any
      thing of weight has yet been advanced of this tendency; and I
      flatter myself, that the observations which have been made in the
      course of these papers have served to place the reverse of that
      position in as clear a light as any matter still in the womb of
      time and experience can be susceptible of. This, at all events,
      must be evident, that the very difficulty itself, drawn from the
      extent of the country, is the strongest argument in favor of an
      energetic government; for any other can certainly never preserve
      the Union of so large an empire. If we embrace the tenets of those
      who oppose the adoption of the proposed Constitution, as the
      standard of our political creed, we cannot fail to verify the
      gloomy doctrines which predict the impracticability of a national
      system pervading entire limits of the present Confederacy. <a
