    sole and exclusive right and power of determining on peace and war,
    except in the cases mentioned in the sixth article &#8212; of
    sending and receiving ambassadors &#8212; entering into treaties and
    alliances, provided that no treaty of commerce shall be made whereby
    the legislative power of the respective States shall be restrained
    from imposing such imposts and duties on foreigners, as their own
    people are subjected to, or from prohibiting the exportation or
    importation of any species of goods or commodities whatsoever
    &#8212; of establishing rules for deciding in all cases, what

    the last resort on appeal in all disputes and differences now
    subsisting or that hereafter may arise between two or more States
    concerning boundary, jurisdiction or any other causes whatever;
    which authority shall always be exercised in the manner following.
    Whenever the legislative or executive authority or lawful agent of
    any State in controversy with another shall present a petition to
    Congress stating the matter in question and praying for a hearing,
    notice thereof shall be given by order of Congress to the
    legislative or executive authority of the other State in
    controversy, and a day assigned for the appearance of the parties by
    their lawful agents, who shall then be directed to appoint by joint
    consent, commissioners or judges to constitute a court for hearing
    and determining the matter in question: but if they cannot agree,
    Congress shall name three persons out of each of the United States,
    and from the list of such persons each party shall alternately
    strike out one, the petitioners beginning, until the number shall be
    reduced to thirteen; and from that number not less than seven, nor
    more than nine names as Congress shall direct, shall in the presence
    of Congress be drawn out by lot, and the persons whose names shall
    be so drawn or any five of them, shall be commissioners or judges,
    to hear and finally determine the controversy, so always as a major
    part of the judges who shall hear the cause shall agree in the
    determination: and if either party shall neglect to attend at the
    day appointed, without showing reasons, which Congress shall judge
    sufficient, or being present shall refuse to strike, the Congress
    shall proceed to nominate three persons out of each State, and the
    secretary of Congress shall strike in behalf of such party absent or
    refusing; and the judgement and sentence of the court to be
    appointed, in the manner before prescribed, shall be final and
    conclusive; and if any of the parties shall refuse to submit to the
    authority of such court, or to appear or defend their claim or
    cause, the court shall nevertheless proceed to pronounce sentence,
    or judgement, which shall in like manner be final and decisive, the
    judgement or sentence and other proceedings being in either case
    transmitted to Congress, and lodged among the acts of Congress for
    the security of the parties concerned: provided that every
    commissioner, before he sits in judgement, shall take an oath to be
    administered by one of the judges of the supreme or superior court
    of the State, where the cause shall be tried, 'well and truly to
    hear and determine the matter in question, according to the best of
    his judgement, without favor, affection or hope of reward': provided
    also, that no State shall be deprived of territory for the benefit
    of the United States. <a class="permalink" href="#a9c2">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="a9c3">All controversies concerning the private right of soil
    claimed under different grants of two or more States, whose
    jurisdictions as they may respect such lands, and the States which
    passed such grants are adjusted, the said grants or either of them
    being at the same time claimed to have originated antecedent to such
    settlement of jurisdiction, shall on the petition of either party to
    the Congress of the United States, be finally determined as near as
    may be in the same manner as is before prescribed for deciding
    disputes respecting territorial jurisdiction between different
    States. <a class="permalink" href="#a9c3">&#182;</a></p>

    <p id="a9c4">The United States in Congress assembled shall also have

    respective States &#8212; fixing the standards of weights and
    measures throughout the United States &#8212; regulating the trade
    and managing all affairs with the Indians, not members of any of the
    States, provided that the legislative right of any State within its
    own limits be not infringed or violated &#8212; establishing or

    the United States, and exacting such postage on the papers passing
    through the same as may be requisite to defray the expenses of the
    said office &#8212; appointing all officers of the land forces, in
    the service of the United States, excepting regimental officers
    &#8212; appointing all the officers of the naval forces, and

    <p id="a9c5">The United States in Congress assembled shall have
    authority to appoint a committee, to sit in the recess of Congress,
    to be denominated 'A Committee of the States', and to consist of one
    delegate from each State; and to appoint such other committees and
    civil officers as may be necessary for managing the general affairs
    of the United States under their direction &#8212; to appoint one of
    their members to preside, provided that no person be allowed to
    serve in the office of president more than one year in any term of
    three years; to ascertain the necessary sums of money to be raised
    for the service of the United States, and to appropriate and apply
    the same for defraying the public expenses &#8212; to borrow money,
    or emit bills on the credit of the United States, transmitting every
    half-year to the respective States an account of the sums of money
    so borrowed or emitted &#8212; to build and equip a navy &#8212; to
    agree upon the number of land forces, and to make requisitions from
    each State for its quota, in proportion to the number of white
    inhabitants in such State; which requisition shall be binding, and
    thereupon the legislature of each State shall appoint the regimental
    officers, raise the men and cloath, arm and equip them in a solid-
    like manner, at the expense of the United States; and the officers
    and men so cloathed, armed and equipped shall march to the place
    appointed, and within the time agreed on by the United States in
    Congress assembled. But if the United States in Congress assembled
    shall, on consideration of circumstances judge proper that any State
    should not raise men, or should raise a smaller number of men than
    the quota thereof, such extra number shall be raised, officered,
    cloathed, armed and equipped in the same manner as the quota of each
    State, unless the legislature of such State shall judge that such
    extra number cannot be safely spread out in the same, in which case
    they shall raise, officer, cloath, arm and equip as many of such
    extra number as they judge can be safely spared. And the officers
    and men so cloathed, armed, and equipped, shall march to the place
    appointed, and within the time agreed on by the United States in
    Congress assembled. <a class="permalink" href="#a9c5">&#182;</a></p>

    regulate the value thereof, nor ascertain the sums and expenses
    necessary for the defense and welfare of the United States, or any

    Committee, for the exercise of which, by the Articles of
    Confederation, the voice of nine States in the Congress of the
    United States assembled be requisite. <a class="permalink"
