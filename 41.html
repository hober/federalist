      General View of the Powers Conferred by The Constitution
    </h2>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><span class="initial">The</span> Constitution proposed
      by the convention may be considered under two general points of
      view. The <em>first</em> relates to the sum or quantity of power
      which it vests in the government, including the restraints imposed
      on the States. The <em>second</em>, to the particular structure of
      the government, and the distribution of this power among its
      several branches. <a class="permalink" href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">Under the <em>first</em> view of the subject, two
      important questions arise: 1. Whether any part of the powers
      transferred to the general government be unnecessary or improper?
      2. Whether the entire mass of them be dangerous to the portion of
      jurisdiction left in the several States? <a class="permalink"
      href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">Is the aggregate power of the general government
      greater than ought to have been vested in it? This is the
      <em>first</em> question. <a class="permalink" href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">It cannot have escaped those who have attended with
      candor to the arguments employed against the extensive powers of
      the government, that the authors of them have very little
      considered how far these powers were necessary means of attaining
      a necessary end. They have chosen rather to dwell on the
      inconveniences which must be unavoidably blended with all
      political advantages; and on the possible abuses which must be
      incident to every power or trust, of which a beneficial use can be
      made. This method of handling the subject cannot impose on the
      good sense of the people of America. It may display the subtlety
      of the writer; it may open a boundless field for rhetoric and
      declamation; it may inflame the passions of the unthinking, and
      may confirm the prejudices of the misthinking: but cool and candid
      people will at once reflect, that the purest of human blessings
      must have a portion of alloy in them; that the choice must always
      be made, if not of the lesser evil, at least of the
      <em>greater</em>, not the <em>perfect</em>, good; and that in
      every political institution, a power to advance the public
      happiness involves a discretion which may be misapplied and
      abused. They will see, therefore, that in all cases where power is
      to be conferred, the point first to be decided is, whether such a
      power be necessary to the public good; as the next will be, in
      case of an affirmative decision, to guard as effectually as
      possible against a perversion of the power to the public
      detriment. <a class="permalink" href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">That we may form a correct judgment on this subject, it
      will be proper to review the several powers conferred on the
      government of the Union; and that this may be the more
      conveniently done they may be reduced into different classes as
      they relate to the following different objects: 1. Security
      against foreign danger; 2. Regulation of the intercourse with
      foreign nations; 3. Maintenance of harmony and proper intercourse
      among the States; 4. Certain miscellaneous objects of general
      utility; 5. Restraint of the States from certain injurious acts;
      6. Provisions for giving due efficacy to all these powers. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">The powers falling within the <em>first</em> class are
      those of <a href="constitution#a1s8c11">declaring war and granting
      letters of marque</a>; of <a href="constitution#a1s8c12">providing
      armies</a> and <a href="constitution#a1s8c13">fleets</a>; of <a
      href="constitution#a1s8c16">regulating</a> and <a
      href="constitution#a1s8c15">calling forth</a> the militia; of <a
      href="constitution#a1s8c1">levying</a> and <a
      href="constitution#a1s8c2">borrowing money</a>. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p7">Security against foreign danger is one of the primitive
      objects of civil society. It is an avowed and essential object of
      the American Union. The powers requisite for attaining it must be
      effectually confided to the federal councils. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p8">Is the power of declaring war necessary? No man will
      answer this question in the negative. It would be superfluous,
      therefore, to enter into a proof of the affirmative. The existing
      Confederation <a href="articles#a9">establishes this power</a> in
      the most ample form. <a class="permalink" href="#p8">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p9">Is the power of raising armies and equipping fleets
      necessary? This is involved in the foregoing power. It is involved
      in the power of self-defense. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p9">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p10">But was it necessary to give an <em>indefinite
      power</em> of raising <em>troops</em>, as well as providing
      fleets; and of maintaining both in <em>peace</em>, as well as in
      war? <a class="permalink" href="#p10">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p11">The answer to these questions has been too far
      anticipated in another place to admit an extensive discussion of
      them in this place. The answer indeed seems to be so obvious and
      conclusive as scarcely to justify such a discussion in any place.
      With what color of propriety could the force necessary for defense
      be limited by those who cannot limit the force of offense? If a
      federal Constitution could chain the ambition or set bounds to the
      exertions of all other nations, then indeed might it prudently
      chain the discretion of its own government, and set bounds to the
      exertions for its own safety. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p11">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p12">How could a readiness for war in time of peace be
      safely prohibited, unless we could prohibit, in like manner, the
      preparations and establishments of every hostile nation? The means
      of security can only be regulated by the means and the danger of
      attack. They will, in fact, be ever determined by these rules, and
      by no others. It is in vain to oppose constitutional barriers to
      the impulse of self-preservation. It is worse than in vain;
      because it plants in the Constitution itself necessary usurpations
      of power, every precedent of which is a germ of unnecessary and
      multiplied repetitions. If one nation maintains constantly a
      disciplined army, ready for the service of ambition or revenge, it
      obliges the most pacific nations who may be within the reach of
      its enterprises to take corresponding precautions. The fifteenth
      century was the unhappy epoch of military establishments in the
      time of peace. They were introduced by Charles VII. of France. All
      Europe has followed, or been forced into, the example. Had the
      example not been followed by other nations, all Europe must long
      ago have worn the chains of a universal monarch. Were every nation
      except France now to disband its peace establishments, the same
      event might follow. The veteran legions of Rome were an overmatch
      for the undisciplined valor of all other nations and rendered her
      the mistress of the world. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p12">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p13">Not the less true is it, that the liberties of Rome
      proved the final victim to her military triumphs; and that the
      liberties of Europe, as far as they ever existed, have, with few
      exceptions, been the price of her military establishments. A
      standing force, therefore, is a dangerous, at the same time that
      it may be a necessary, provision. On the smallest scale it has its
      inconveniences. On an extensive scale its consequences may be
      fatal. On any scale it is an object of laudable circumspection and
      precaution. A wise nation will combine all these considerations;
      and, whilst it does not rashly preclude itself from any resource
      which may become essential to its safety, will exert all its
      prudence in diminishing both the necessity and the danger of
      resorting to one which may be inauspicious to its liberties. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p13">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p14">The clearest marks of this prudence are stamped on the
      proposed Constitution. The Union itself, which it cements and
      secures, destroys every pretext for a military establishment which
      could be dangerous. America united, with a handful of troops, or
      without a single soldier, exhibits a more forbidding posture to
      foreign ambition than America disunited, with a hundred thousand
      veterans ready for combat. It was remarked, on a former occasion,
      that the want of this pretext had saved the liberties of one
      nation in Europe. Being rendered by her insular situation and her
      maritime resources impregnable to the armies of her neighbors, the
      rulers of Great Britain have never been able, by real or
      artificial dangers, to cheat the public into an extensive peace
      establishment. The distance of the United States from the powerful
      nations of the world gives them the same happy security. A
      dangerous establishment can never be necessary or plausible, so
      long as they continue a united people. But let it never, for a
      moment, be forgotten that they are indebted for this advantage to
      the Union alone. The moment of its dissolution will be the date of
      a new order of things. The fears of the weaker, or the ambition of
      the stronger States, or Confederacies, will set the same example
      in the New, as Charles VII. did in the Old World. The example will
      be followed here from the same motives which produced universal
      imitation there. Instead of deriving from our situation the
      precious advantage which Great Britain has derived from hers, the
      face of America will be but a copy of that of the continent of
      Europe. It will present liberty everywhere crushed between
      standing armies and perpetual taxes. The fortunes of disunited
      America will be even more disastrous than those of Europe. The
      sources of evil in the latter are confined to her own limits. No
      superior powers of another quarter of the globe intrigue among her
      rival nations, inflame their mutual animosities, and render them
      the instruments of foreign ambition, jealousy, and revenge. In
      America the miseries springing from her internal jealousies,
      contentions, and wars, would form a part only of her lot. A
      plentiful addition of evils would have their source in that
      relation in which Europe stands to this quarter of the earth, and
      which no other quarter of the earth bears to Europe. This picture
      of the consequences of disunion cannot be too highly colored, or
      too often exhibited. Every man who loves peace, every man who
      loves his country, every man who loves liberty, ought to have it
      ever before his eyes, that he may cherish in his heart a due
      attachment to the Union of America, and be able to set a due value
      on the means of preserving it. Next to the effectual establishment
      of the Union, the best possible precaution against danger from
      standing armies is a limitation of the term for which revenue may
      be appropriated to their support. This precaution the Constitution
      has prudently added. I will not repeat here the observations which
      I flatter myself have placed this subject in a just and
      satisfactory light. But it may not be improper to take notice of
      an argument against this part of the Constitution, which has been
      drawn from the policy and practice of Great Britain. It is said
      that the continuance of an army in that kingdom requires an annual
      vote of the legislature; whereas the American Constitution has
      lengthened this critical period to two years. This is the form in
      which the comparison is usually stated to the public: but is it a
      just form? Is it a fair comparison? Does the British Constitution
      restrain the parliamentary discretion to one year? Does the
      American impose on the Congress appropriations for two years? On
      the contrary, it cannot be unknown to the authors of the fallacy
      themselves, that the British Constitution fixes no limit whatever
      to the discretion of the legislature, and that the American ties
      down the legislature to two years, as the longest admissible term.
      <a class="permalink" href="#p14">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p15">Had the argument from the British example been truly
      stated, it would have stood thus: The term for which supplies may
      be appropriated to the army establishment, though unlimited by the
      British Constitution, has nevertheless, in practice, been limited
      by parliamentary discretion to a single year. Now, if in Great
      Britain, where the House of Commons is elected for seven years;
      where so great a proportion of the members are elected by so small
      a proportion of the people; where the electors are so corrupted by
      the representatives, and the representatives so corrupted by the
      Crown, the representative body can possess a power to make
      appropriations to the army for an indefinite term, without
      desiring, or without daring, to extend the term beyond a single
      year, ought not suspicion herself to blush, in pretending that the
      representatives of the United States, elected <em>freely</em> by
      the <em>whole body</em> of the people, every <em>second year</em>,
      cannot be safely intrusted with the discretion over such
      appropriations, expressly limited to the short period of <em>two
      years</em>? <a class="permalink" href="#p15">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p16">A bad cause seldom fails to betray itself. Of this
      truth, the management of the opposition to the federal government
      is an unvaried exemplification. But among all the blunders which
      have been committed, none is more striking than the attempt to
      enlist on that side the prudent jealousy entertained by the
      people, of standing armies. The attempt has awakened fully the
      public attention to that important subject; and has led to
      investigations which must terminate in a thorough and universal
      conviction, not only that the constitution has provided the most
      effectual guards against danger from that quarter, but that
      nothing short of a Constitution fully adequate to the national
      defense and the preservation of the Union, can save America from
      as many standing armies as it may be split into States or
      Confederacies, and from such a progressive augmentation, of these
      establishments in each, as will render them as burdensome to the
      properties and ominous to the liberties of the people, as any
      establishment that can become necessary, under a united and
      efficient government, must be tolerable to the former and safe to
      the latter. <a class="permalink" href="#p16">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p17">The palpable necessity of the power to provide and
      maintain a navy has protected that part of the Constitution
      against a spirit of censure, which has spared few other parts. It
      must, indeed, be numbered among the greatest blessings of America,
      that as her Union will be the only source of her maritime
      strength, so this will be a principal source of her security
      against danger from abroad. In this respect our situation bears
      another likeness to the insular advantage of Great Britain. The
      batteries most capable of repelling foreign enterprises on our
      safety, are happily such as can never be turned by a perfidious
      government against our liberties. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p17">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p18">The inhabitants of the Atlantic frontier are all of
      them deeply interested in this provision for naval protection, and
      if they have hitherto been suffered to sleep quietly in their
      beds; if their property has remained safe against the predatory
      spirit of licentious adventurers; if their maritime towns have not
      yet been compelled to ransom themselves from the terrors of a
      conflagration, by yielding to the exactions of daring and sudden
      invaders, these instances of good fortune are not to be ascribed
      to the capacity of the existing government for the protection of
      those from whom it claims allegiance, but to causes that are
      fugitive and fallacious. If we except perhaps Virginia and
      Maryland, which are peculiarly vulnerable on their eastern
      frontiers, no part of the Union ought to feel more anxiety on this
      subject than New York. Her seacoast is extensive. A very important
      district of the State is an island. The State itself is penetrated
      by a large navigable river for more than fifty leagues. The great
      emporium of its commerce, the great reservoir of its wealth, lies
      every moment at the mercy of events, and may almost be regarded as
      a hostage for ignominious compliances with the dictates of a
      foreign enemy, or even with the rapacious demands of pirates and
      barbarians. Should a war be the result of the precarious situation
      of European affairs, and all the unruly passions attending it be
      let loose on the ocean, our escape from insults and depredations,
      not only on that element, but every part of the other bordering on
      it, will be truly miraculous. In the present condition of America,
      the States more immediately exposed to these calamities have
      nothing to hope from the phantom of a general government which now
      exists; and if their single resources were equal to the task of
      fortifying themselves against the danger, the object to be
      protected would be almost consumed by the means of protecting
      them. <a class="permalink" href="#p18">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p19">The power of regulating and calling forth the militia
      has been already sufficiently vindicated and explained. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p19">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p20">The power of levying and borrowing money, being the
      sinew of that which is to be exerted in the national defense, is
      properly thrown into the same class with it. This power, also, has
      been examined already with much attention, and has, I trust, been
      clearly shown to be necessary, both in the extent and form given
      to it by the Constitution. I will address one additional
      reflection only to those who contend that the power ought to have
      been restrained to external taxation by which they mean, taxes on
      articles imported from other countries. It cannot be doubted that
      this will always be a valuable source of revenue; that for a
      considerable time it must be a principal source; that at this
      moment it is an essential one. But we may form very mistaken ideas
      on this subject, if we do not call to mind in our calculations,
      that the extent of revenue drawn from foreign commerce must vary
      with the variations, both in the extent and the kind of imports;
      and that these variations do not correspond with the progress of
      population, which must be the general measure of the public wants.
      As long as agriculture continues the sole field of labor, the
      importation of manufactures must increase as the consumers
      multiply. As soon as domestic manufactures are begun by the hands
      not called for by agriculture, the imported manufactures will
      decrease as the numbers of people increase. In a more remote
      stage, the imports may consist in a considerable part of raw
      materials, which will be wrought into articles for exportation,
      and will, therefore, require rather the encouragement of bounties,
      than to be loaded with discouraging duties. A system of
      government, meant for duration, ought to contemplate these
      revolutions, and be able to accommodate itself to them. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p20">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p21">Some, who have not denied the necessity of the power
      of taxation, have grounded a very fierce attack against the
      Constitution, on <a href="constitution#a1s8c1">the language in
      which it is defined</a>. It has been urged and echoed, that the
      power <q cite="constitution#a1s8c1">to lay and collect taxes,
      duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the debts, and provide for
      the common defense and general welfare of the United States,</q>
      amounts to an unlimited commission to exercise every power which
      may be alleged to be necessary for the common defense or general
      welfare. No stronger proof could be given of the distress under
      which these writers labor for objections, than their stooping to
      such a misconstruction. <a class="permalink" href="#p21">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p22">Had no other enumeration or definition of the powers
      of the Congress been found in the Constitution, than the general
      expressions just cited, the authors of the objection might have
      had some color for it; though it would have been difficult to find
      a reason for so awkward a form of describing an authority to
      legislate in all possible cases. A power to destroy the freedom of
      the press, the trial by jury, or even to regulate the course of
      descents, or the forms of conveyances, must be very singularly
      expressed by the terms <q cite="constitution#a1s8c1">to raise
      money for the general welfare.</q> <a class="permalink"
      href="#p22">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p23">But what color can the objection have, when a
      specification of the objects alluded to by these general terms
      immediately follows, and is not even separated by a longer pause
      than a semicolon? If the different parts of the same instrument
      ought to be so expounded, as to give meaning to every part which
      will bear it, shall one part of the same sentence be excluded
      altogether from a share in the meaning; and shall the more
      doubtful and indefinite terms be retained in their full extent,
      and the clear and precise expressions be denied any signification
      whatsoever? For what purpose could the enumeration of particular
      powers be inserted, if these and all others were meant to be
      included in the preceding general power? Nothing is more natural
      nor common than first to use a general phrase, and then to explain
      and qualify it by a recital of particulars. But the idea of an
      enumeration of particulars which neither explain nor qualify the
      general meaning, and can have no other effect than to confound and
      mislead, is an absurdity, which, as we are reduced to the dilemma
      of charging either on the authors of the objection or on the
      authors of the Constitution, we must take the liberty of
      supposing, had not its origin with the latter. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p23">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p24">The objection here is the more extraordinary, as it
      appears that the language used by the convention is a copy from
      the articles of Confederation. The objects of the Union among the
      States, as described in <a href="articles#a3">article third</a>,
      are <q cite="articles#a3">their common defense, security of their
      liberties, and mutual and general welfare.</q> The terms of <a
      href="articles#a8">article eighth</a> are still more identical: <q
      cite="articles#a8">All charges of war and all other expenses that
      shall be incurred for the common defense or general welfare, and
      allowed by the United States in Congress, shall be defrayed out of
      a common treasury,</q> etc. A similar language again occurs in <a
      href="articles#a9">article ninth</a>. Construe either of these
      articles by the rules which would justify the construction put on
      the new Constitution, and they vest in the existing Congress a
      power to legislate in all cases whatsoever. But what would have
      been thought of that assembly, if, attaching themselves to these
      general expressions, and disregarding the specifications which
      ascertain and limit their import, they had exercised an unlimited
      power of providing for the common defense and general welfare? I
      appeal to the objectors themselves, whether they would in that
      case have employed the same reasoning in justification of Congress
