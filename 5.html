      Concerning Dangers From Foreign Force and Influence

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><span class="initial">Queen Anne</span>, in her letter
      of the 1<sup>st</sup> July, 1706, to the Scotch Parliament, makes some
      observations on the importance of the <em>union</em> then forming
      between England and Scotland, which merit our attention. I shall
      present the public with one or two extracts from it: <q
      id="anne1">An entire and perfect union will be the solid
      foundation of lasting peace: It will secure your religion,
      liberty, and property; remove the animosities amongst yourselves,
      and the jealousies and differences betwixt our two kingdoms. It
      must increase your strength, riches, and trade; and by this union
      the whole island, being joined in affection and free from all
      apprehensions of different interest, will be <em>enabled to resist
      all its enemies</em>.</q> <q>We most earnestly recommend to you
      calmness and unanimity in this great and weighty affair, that the
      union may be brought to a happy conclusion, being the only
      <em>effectual</em> way to secure our present and future happiness,
      and disappoint the designs of our and your enemies, who will
      doubtless, on this occasion, <em>use their utmost endeavors to
      prevent or delay this union</em>.</q> <a class="permalink"
      href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">It was remarked in <a href="4">the preceding paper</a>,
      that weakness and divisions at home would invite dangers from
      abroad; and that nothing would tend more to secure us from them
      than union, strength, and good government within ourselves. This
      subject is copious and cannot easily be exhausted. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">The history of Great Britain is the one with which we
      are in general the best acquainted, and it gives us many useful
      lessons. We may profit by their experience without paying the
      price which it cost them. Although it seems obvious to common
      sense that the people of such an island should be but one nation,
      yet we find that they were for ages divided into three, and that
      those three were almost constantly embroiled in quarrels and wars
      with one another. Notwithstanding their true interest with respect
      to the continental nations was really the same, yet by the arts
      and policy and practices of those nations, their mutual jealousies
      were perpetually kept inflamed, and for a long series of years
      they were far more inconvenient and troublesome than they were
      useful and assisting to each other. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">Should the people of America divide themselves into
      three or four nations, would not the same thing happen? Would not
      similar jealousies arise, and be in like manner cherished? Instead
      of their being <q cite="#anne1">joined in affection</q> and free
      from all apprehension of different <q cite="#anne1">interests,</q>
      envy and jealousy would soon extinguish confidence and affection,
      and the partial interests of each confederacy, instead of the
      general interests of all America, would be the only objects of
      their policy and pursuits. Hence, like most other
      <em>bordering</em> nations, they would always be either involved
      in disputes and war, or live in the constant apprehension of them.
      <a class="permalink" href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">The most sanguine advocates for three or four
      confederacies cannot reasonably suppose that they would long
      remain exactly on an equal footing in point of strength, even if
      it was possible to form them so at first; but, admitting that to
      be practicable, yet what human contrivance can secure the
      continuance of such equality? Independent of those local
      circumstances which tend to beget and increase power in one part
      and to impede its progress in another, we must advert to the
      effects of that superior policy and good management which would
      probably distinguish the government of one above the rest, and by
      which their relative equality in strength and consideration would
      be destroyed. For it cannot be presumed that the same degree of
      sound policy, prudence, and foresight would uniformly be observed
      by each of these confederacies for a long succession of years. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">Whenever, and from whatever causes, it might happen,
      and happen it would, that any one of these nations or
      confederacies should rise on the scale of political importance
      much above the degree of her neighbors, that moment would those
      neighbors behold her with envy and with fear. Both those passions
      would lead them to countenance, if not to promote, whatever might
      promise to diminish her importance; and would also restrain them
      from measures calculated to advance or even to secure her
      prosperity. Much time would not be necessary to enable her to
      discern these unfriendly dispositions. She would soon begin, not
      only to lose confidence in her neighbors, but also to feel a
      disposition equally unfavorable to them. Distrust naturally
      creates distrust, and by nothing is good-will and kind conduct
      more speedily changed than by invidious jealousies and uncandid
      imputations, whether expressed or implied. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p7">The North is generally the region of strength, and many
      local circumstances render it probable that the most Northern of
      the proposed confederacies would, at a period not very distant, be
      unquestionably more formidable than any of the others. No sooner
      would this become evident than the <em>northern hive</em> would
      excite the same ideas and sensations in the more southern parts of
      America which it formerly did in the southern parts of Europe. Nor
      does it appear to be a rash conjecture that its young swarms might
      often be tempted to gather honey in the more blooming fields and
      milder air of their luxurious and more delicate neighbors. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p8">They who well consider the history of similar divisions
      and confederacies will find abundant reason to apprehend that
      those in contemplation would in no other sense be neighbors than
      as they would be borderers; that they would neither love nor trust
      one another, but on the contrary would be a prey to discord,
      jealousy, and mutual injuries; in short, that they would place us
      exactly in the situations in which some nations doubtless wish to
      see us, viz., <em>formidable only to each other</em>. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p8">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p9">From these considerations it appears that those
      gentlemen are greatly mistaken who suppose that alliances
      offensive and defensive might be formed between these
      confederacies, and would produce that combination and union of
      wills of arms and of resources, which would be necessary to put
      and keep them in a formidable state of defense against foreign
      enemies. <a class="permalink" href="#p9">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p10">When did the independent states, into which Britain
      and Spain were formerly divided, combine in such alliance, or
      unite their forces against a foreign enemy? The proposed
      confederacies will be <em>distinct nations</em>. Each of them
      would have its commerce with foreigners to regulate by distinct
      treaties; and as their productions and commodities are different
      and proper for different markets, so would those treaties be
      essentially different. Different commercial concerns must create
      different interests, and of course different degrees of political
      attachment to and connection with different foreign nations. Hence
      it might and probably would happen that the foreign nation with
      whom the <em>southern</em> confederacy might be at war would be
      the one with whom the <em>northern</em> confederacy would be the
      most desirous of preserving peace and friendship. An alliance so
      contrary to their immediate interest would not therefore be easy
      to form, nor, if formed, would it be observed and fulfilled with
      perfect good faith. <a class="permalink" href="#p10">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p11">Nay, it is far more probable that in America, as in
      Europe, neighboring nations, acting under the impulse of opposite
      interests and unfriendly passions, would frequently be found
      taking different sides. Considering our distance from Europe, it
      would be more natural for these confederacies to apprehend danger
      from one another than from distant nations, and therefore that
      each of them should be more desirous to guard against the others
      by the aid of foreign alliances, than to guard against foreign
      dangers by alliances between themselves. And here let us not
      forget how much more easy it is to receive foreign fleets into our
      ports, and foreign armies into our country, than it is to persuade
      or compel them to depart. How many conquests did the Romans and
      others make in the characters of allies, and what innovations did
      they under the same character introduce into the governments of
      those whom they pretended to protect. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p11">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p12">Let candid men judge, then, whether the division of
      America into any given number of independent sovereignties would
      tend to secure us against the hostilities and improper
      interference of foreign nations. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p12">&#182;</a></p>
