      Concerning the General Power of Taxation
    </h3>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><span class="initial">Although</span> I am of opinion
      that there would be no real danger of the consequences which seem
      to be apprehended to the State governments from a power in the
      Union to control them in the levies of money, because I am
      persuaded that the sense of the people, the extreme hazard of
      provoking the resentments of the State governments, and a
      conviction of the utility and necessity of local administrations
      for local purposes, would be a complete barrier against the
      oppressive use of such a power; yet I am willing here to allow, in
      its full extent, the justness of the reasoning which requires that
      the individual States should possess an independent and
      uncontrollable authority to raise their own revenues for the
      supply of their own wants. And making this concession, I affirm
      that (with the sole exception of duties on imports and exports)
      they would, under the plan of the convention, retain that
      authority in the most absolute and unqualified sense; and that an
      attempt on the part of the national government to abridge them in
      the exercise of it, would be a violent assumption of power,
      unwarranted by any article or clause of its Constitution. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">An entire consolidation of the States into one complete
      national sovereignty would imply an entire subordination of the
      parts; and whatever powers might remain in them, would be
      altogether dependent on the general will. But as the plan of the
      convention aims only at a partial union or consolidation, the
      State governments would clearly retain all the rights of
      sovereignty which they before had, and which were not, by that
      act, <em>exclusively</em> delegated to the United States. This
      exclusive delegation, or rather this alienation, of State
      sovereignty, would only exist in three cases: where the
      Constitution in express terms granted an exclusive authority to
      the Union; where it granted in one instance an authority to the
      Union, and in another prohibited the States from exercising the
      like authority; and where it granted an authority to the Union, to
      which a similar authority in the States would be absolutely and
      totally <em>contradictory</em> and <em>repugnant</em>. I use these
      terms to distinguish this last case from another which might
      appear to resemble it, but which would, in fact, be essentially
      different; I mean where the exercise of a concurrent jurisdiction
      might be productive of occasional interferences in the
      <em>policy</em> of any branch of administration, but would not
      imply any direct contradiction or repugnancy in point of
      constitutional authority. These three cases of exclusive
      jurisdiction in the federal government may be exemplified by the
      following instances: The <a href="constitution#a1s8c17">last
      clause but one in the eighth section of the first article</a>
      provides expressly that Congress shall exercise <q><em>exclusive
      legislation</em></q> over the district to be appropriated as the
      seat of government. This answers to the first case. <a
      href="constitution#a1s8c1">The first clause of the same
      section</a> empowers Congress <q><em>to lay and collect taxes,
      duties, imposts and excises</em></q>; and the <a
      href="constitution#a1s10c2">second clause of the tenth section of
      the same article</a> declares that, <q><em>no state shall</em>,
      without the consent of Congress, <em>lay any imposts or duties on
      imports or exports</em>, except for the purpose of executing its
      inspection laws.</q> Hence would result an exclusive power in the
      Union to lay duties on imports and exports, with the particular
      exception mentioned; but this power is abridged by <a
      href="constitution#a1s9c5">another clause</a>, which declares that
      no tax or duty shall be laid on articles exported from any State;
      in consequence of which qualification, it now only extends to the
      <em>duties on imports</em>. This answers to the second case. The
      third will be found in <a href="constitution#a1s8c4">that
      clause</a> which declares that Congress shall have power <q>to
      establish an <em>uniform rule</em> of naturalization throughout
      the United States.</q> This must necessarily be exclusive; because
      if each State had power to prescribe a <em>distinct rule</em>,
      there could not be a <em>uniform rule</em>. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">A case which may perhaps be thought to resemble the
      latter, but which is in fact widely different, affects the
      question immediately under consideration. I mean the power of
      imposing taxes on all articles other than exports and imports.
      This, I contend, is manifestly a concurrent and coequal authority
      in the United States and in the individual States. There is
      plainly no expression in the <a
      href="constitution#a1s8c1">granting clause</a> which makes that
      power <em>exclusive</em> in the Union. There is no independent
      clause or sentence which prohibits the States from exercising it.
      So far is this from being the case, that a plain and conclusive
      argument to the contrary is to be deduced from <a
      href="constitution#a1s10c2">the restraint laid upon the States in
      relation to duties on imports and exports</a>. This restriction
      implies an admission that, if it were not inserted, the States
      would possess the power it excludes; and it implies a further
      admission, that as to all other taxes, the authority of the States
      remains undiminished. In any other view it would be both
      unnecessary and dangerous; it would be unnecessary, because if the
      grant to the Union of the power of laying such duties implied the
      exclusion of the States, or even their subordination in this
      particular, there could be no need of such a restriction; it would
      be dangerous, because the introduction of it leads directly to the
      conclusion which has been mentioned, and which, if the reasoning
      of the objectors be just, could not have been intended; I mean
      that the States, in all cases to which the restriction did not
      apply, would have a concurrent power of taxation with the Union.
      The restriction in question amounts to what lawyers call a
      <em>negative pregnant</em> that is, a <em>negation</em> of one
      thing, and an <em>affirmance</em> of another; a negation of the
      authority of the States to impose taxes on imports and exports,
      and an affirmance of their authority to impose them on all other
      articles. It would be mere sophistry to argue that it was meant to
      exclude them <em>absolutely</em> from the imposition of taxes of
      the former kind, and to leave them at liberty to lay others
      <em>subject to the control</em> of the national legislature. The
      <a href="constitution#a1s10c2">restraining or prohibitory
      clause</a> only says, that they shall not, <em>without the consent
      of congress</em>, lay such duties; and if we are to understand
      this in the sense last mentioned, the Constitution would then be
      made to introduce a formal provision for the sake of a very absurd
      conclusion; which is, that the States, <em>with the consent</em>
      of the national legislature, might tax imports and exports; and
      that they might tax every other article, <em>unless
      controlled</em> by the same body. If this was the intention, why
      not leave it, in the first instance, to what is alleged to be the
      natural operation of the original clause, conferring a general
      power of taxation upon the Union? It is evident that this could
      not have been the intention, and that it will not bear a
      construction of the kind. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">As to a supposition of repugnancy between the power of
      taxation in the States and in the Union, it cannot be supported in
      that sense which would be requisite to work an exclusion of the
      States. It is, indeed, possible that a tax might be laid on a
      particular article by a State which might render it
      <em>inexpedient</em> that thus a further tax should be laid on the
      same article by the Union; but it would not imply a constitutional
      inability to impose a further tax. The quantity of the imposition,
      the expediency or inexpediency of an increase on either side,
      would be mutually questions of prudence; but there would be
      involved no direct contradiction of power. The particular policy
      of the national and of the State systems of finance might now and
      then not exactly coincide, and might require reciprocal
      forbearances. It is not, however a mere possibility of
      inconvenience in the exercise of powers, but an immediate
      constitutional repugnancy that can by implication alienate and
      extinguish a pre-existing right of sovereignty. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">The necessity of a concurrent jurisdiction in certain
      cases results from the division of the sovereign power; and the
      rule that all authorities, of which the States are not explicitly
      divested in favor of the Union, remain with them in full vigor, is
      not a theoretical consequence of that division, but is clearly
      admitted by the whole tenor of the instrument which contains the
      articles of the proposed Constitution. We there find that,
      notwithstanding the affirmative grants of general authorities,
      there has been the most pointed care in those cases where it was
      deemed improper that the like authorities should reside in the
      States, to insert negative clauses prohibiting the exercise of
      them by the States. The <a href="constitution#a1s10">tenth section
      of the first article</a> consists altogether of such provisions.
      This circumstance is a clear indication of the sense of the
      convention, and furnishes a rule of interpretation out of the body
      of the act, which justifies the position I have advanced and
      refutes every hypothesis to the contrary. <a class="permalink"
