    <h2 class="entry-summary">
      The Alleged Tendency of the New Plan to Elevate the Few at the
      Expense of the Many Considered in Connection with Representation
    </h2>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><span class="initial">The third</span> charge against
      the House of Representatives is, that it will be taken from that
      class of citizens which will have least sympathy with the mass of
      the people, and be most likely to aim at an ambitious sacrifice of
      the many to the aggrandizement of the few. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">Of all the objections which have been framed against
      the federal Constitution, this is perhaps the most extraordinary.
      Whilst the objection itself is levelled against a pretended
      oligarchy, the principle of it strikes at the very root of
      republican government. <a class="permalink" href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">The aim of every political constitution is, or ought to
      be, first to obtain for rulers men who possess most wisdom to
      discern, and most virtue to pursue, the common good of the
      society; and in the next place, to take the most effectual
      precautions for keeping them virtuous whilst they continue to hold
      their public trust. The elective mode of obtaining rulers is the
      characteristic policy of republican government. The means relied
      on in this form of government for preventing their degeneracy are
      numerous and various. The most effectual one, is such a limitation
      of the term of appointments as will maintain a proper
      responsibility to the people. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">Let me now ask what circumstance there is in the
      constitution of the House of Representatives that violates the
      principles of republican government, or favors the elevation of
      the few on the ruins of the many? Let me ask whether every
      circumstance is not, on the contrary, strictly conformable to
      these principles, and scrupulously impartial to the rights and
      pretensions of every class and description of citizens? <a
      class="permalink" href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">Who are to be the electors of the federal
      representatives? Not the rich, more than the poor; not the
      learned, more than the ignorant; not the haughty heirs of
      distinguished names, more than the humble sons of obscurity and
      unpropitious fortune. The electors are to be the great body of the
      people of the United States. They are to be the same who exercise
      the right in every State of electing the corresponding branch of
      the legislature of the State. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">Who are to be the objects of popular choice? Every
      citizen whose merit may recommend him to the esteem and confidence
      of his country. No qualification of wealth, of birth, of religious
      faith, or of civil profession is permitted to fetter the judgement
      or disappoint the inclination of the people. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p7">If we consider the situation of the men on whom the
      free suffrages of their fellow-citizens may confer the
      representative trust, we shall find it involving every security
      which can be devised or desired for their fidelity to their
      constituents. <a class="permalink" href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p8">In the first place, as they will have been
      distinguished by the preference of their fellow-citizens, we are
      to presume that in general they will be somewhat distinguished
      also by those qualities which entitle them to it, and which
      promise a sincere and scrupulous regard to the nature of their
      engagements. <a class="permalink" href="#p8">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p9">In the second place, they will enter into the public
      service under circumstances which cannot fail to produce a
      temporary affection at least to their constituents. There is in
      every breast a sensibility to marks of honor, of favor, of esteem,
      and of confidence, which, apart from all considerations of
      interest, is some pledge for grateful and benevolent returns.
      Ingratitude is a common topic of declamation against human nature;
      and it must be confessed that instances of it are but too frequent
      and flagrant, both in public and in private life. But the
      universal and extreme indignation which it inspires is itself a
      proof of the energy and prevalence of the contrary sentiment. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p9">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p10">In the third place, those ties which bind the
      representative to his constituents are strengthened by motives of
      a more selfish nature. His pride and vanity attach him to a form
      of government which favors his pretensions and gives him a share
      in its honors and distinctions. Whatever hopes or projects might
      be entertained by a few aspiring characters, it must generally
      happen that a great proportion of the men deriving their
      advancement from their influence with the people, would have more
      to hope from a preservation of the favor, than from innovations in
      the government subversive of the authority of the people. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p10">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p11">All these securities, however, would be found very
      insufficient without the restraint of frequent elections. Hence,
      in the fourth place, the House of Representatives is so
      constituted as to support in the members an habitual recollection
      of their dependence on the people. Before the sentiments impressed
      on their minds by the mode of their elevation can be effaced by
      the exercise of power, they will be compelled to anticipate the
      moment when their power is to cease, when their exercise of it is
      to be reviewed, and when they must descend to the level from which
      they were raised; there forever to remain unless a faithful
      discharge of their trust shall have established their title to a
      renewal of it. <a class="permalink" href="#p11">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p12">I will add, as a fifth circumstance in the situation
      of the House of Representatives, restraining them from oppressive
      measures, that they can make no law which will not have its full
      operation on themselves and their friends, as well as on the great
      mass of the society. This has always been deemed one of the
      strongest bonds by which human policy can connect the rulers and
      the people together. It creates between them that communion of
      interests and sympathy of sentiments, of which few governments
      have furnished examples; but without which every government
      degenerates into tyranny. If it be asked, what is to restrain the
      House of Representatives from making legal discriminations in
      favor of themselves and a particular class of the society? I
      answer: the genius of the whole system; the nature of just and
      constitutional laws; and above all, the vigilant and manly spirit
      which actuates the people of America, a spirit which nourishes
      freedom, and in return is nourished by it. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p12">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p13">If this spirit shall ever be so far debased as to
      tolerate a law not obligatory on the legislature, as well as on
      the people, the people will be prepared to tolerate any thing but
      liberty. <a class="permalink" href="#p13">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p14">Such will be the relation between the House of
      Representatives and their constituents. Duty, gratitude, interest,
      ambition itself, are the chords by which they will be bound to
      fidelity and sympathy with the great mass of the people. It is
      possible that these may all be insufficient to control the caprice
      and wickedness of man. But are they not all that government will
      admit, and that human prudence can devise? Are they not the
      genuine and the characteristic means by which republican
      government provides for the liberty and happiness of the people?
      Are they not the identical means on which every State government
      in the Union relies for the attainment of these important ends?
      What then are we to understand by the objection which this paper
      has combated? What are we to say to the men who profess the most
      flaming zeal for republican government, yet boldly impeach the
      fundamental principle of it; who pretend to be champions for the
      right and the capacity of the people to choose their own rulers,
      yet maintain that they will prefer those only who will immediately
      and infallibly betray the trust committed to them? <a
      class="permalink" href="#p14">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p15">Were the objection to be read by one who had not seen
      the mode prescribed by the Constitution for the choice of
      representatives, he could suppose nothing less than that some
      unreasonable qualification of property was annexed to the right of
      suffrage; or that the right of eligibility was limited to persons
      of particular families or fortunes; or at least that the mode
      prescribed by the State constitutions was in some respect or
      other, very grossly departed from. We have seen how far such a
      supposition would err, as to the two first points. Nor would it,
      in fact, be less erroneous as to the last. The only difference
      discoverable between the two cases is, that each representative of
      the United States will be elected by five or six thousand
      citizens; whilst in the individual States, the election of a
      representative is left to about as many hundreds. Will it be
      pretended that this difference is sufficient to justify an
      attachment to the State governments, and an abhorrence to the
      federal government? If this be the point on which the objection
      turns, it deserves to be examined. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p15">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p16">Is it supported by <em>reason</em>? This cannot be
      said, without maintaining that five or six thousand citizens are
      less capable of choosing a fit representative, or more liable to
      be corrupted by an unfit one, than five or six hundred. Reason, on
      the contrary, assures us, that as in so great a number a fit
      representative would be most likely to be found, so the choice
      would be less likely to be diverted from him by the intrigues of
      the ambitious or the ambitious or the bribes of the rich. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p16">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p17">Is the <em>consequence</em> from this doctrine
      admissible? If we say that five or six hundred citizens are as
      many as can jointly exercise their right of suffrage, must we not
      deprive the people of the immediate choice of their public
      servants, in every instance where the administration of the
      government does not require as many of them as will amount to one
      for that number of citizens? <a class="permalink"
      href="#p17">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p18">Is the doctrine warranted by <em>facts</em>? It was
      shown in the last paper, that the real representation in the
      British House of Commons very little exceeds the proportion of one
      for every thirty thousand inhabitants. Besides a variety of
      powerful causes not existing here, and which favor in that country
      the pretensions of rank and wealth, no person is eligible as a
      representative of a county, unless he possess real estate of the
      clear value of six hundred pounds sterling per year; nor of a city
      or borough, unless he possess a like estate of half that annual
      value. To this qualification on the part of the county
      representatives is added another on the part of the county
      electors, which restrains the right of suffrage to persons having
      a freehold estate of the annual value of more than twenty pounds
      sterling, according to the present rate of money. Notwithstanding
      these unfavorable circumstances, and notwithstanding some very
      unequal laws in the British code, it cannot be said that the
      representatives of the nation have elevated the few on the ruins
      of the many. <a class="permalink" href="#p18">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p19">But we need not resort to foreign experience on this
      subject. Our own is explicit and decisive. The districts in New
      Hampshire in which the senators are chosen immediately by the
      people, are nearly as large as will be necessary for her
      representatives in the Congress. Those of Massachusetts are larger
      than will be necessary for that purpose; and those of New York
      still more so. In the last State the members of Assembly for the
      cities and counties of New York and Albany are elected by very
      nearly as many voters as will be entitled to a representative in
      the Congress, calculating on the number of sixty-five
      representatives only. It makes no difference that in these
      senatorial districts and counties a number of representatives are
      voted for by each elector at the same time. If the same electors
      at the same time are capable of choosing four or five
      representatives, they cannot be incapable of choosing one.
      Pennsylvania is an additional example. Some of her counties, which
      elect her State representatives, are almost as large as her
      districts will be by which her federal representatives will be
      elected. The city of Philadelphia is supposed to contain between
      fifty and sixty thousand souls. It will therefore form nearly two
      districts for the choice of federal representatives. It forms,
      however, but one county, in which every elector votes for each of
      its representatives in the State legislature. And what may appear
      to be still more directly to our purpose, the whole city actually
      elects a <em>single member</em> for the executive council. This is
      the case in all the other counties of the State. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p19">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p20">Are not these facts the most satisfactory proofs of
      the fallacy which has been employed against the branch of the
      federal government under consideration? Has it appeared on trial
      that the senators of New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and New York,
      or the executive council of Pennsylvania, or the members of the
      Assembly in the two last States, have betrayed any peculiar
      disposition to sacrifice the many to the few, or are in any
      respect less worthy of their places than the representatives and
      magistrates appointed in other States by very small divisions of
      the people? <a class="permalink" href="#p20">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p21">But there are cases of a stronger complexion than any
      which I have yet quoted. One branch of the legislature of
      Connecticut is so constituted that each member of it is elected by
      the whole State. So is the governor of that State, of
      Massachusetts, and of this State, and the president of New
      Hampshire. I leave every man to decide whether the result of any
      one of these experiments can be said to countenance a suspicion,
      that a diffusive mode of choosing representatives of the people
      tends to elevate traitors and to undermine the public liberty. <a
