      Concerning Dangers From Foreign Force and Influence
    </h3>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><span class="initial">It is</span> not a new
      observation that the people of any country (if, like the
      Americans, intelligent and well-informed) seldom adopt and
      steadily persevere for many years in an erroneous opinion
      respecting their interests. That consideration naturally tends to
      create great respect for the high opinion which the people of
      America have so long and uniformly entertained of the importance
      of their continuing firmly united under one federal government,
      vested with sufficient powers for all general and national
      purposes. <a class="permalink" href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">The more attentively I consider and investigate the
      reasons which appear to have given birth to this opinion, the more
      I become convinced that they are cogent and conclusive. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">Among the many objects to which a wise and free people
      find it necessary to direct their attention, that of providing for
      their <em>safety</em> seems to be the first. The <em>safety</em>
      of the people doubtless has relation to a great variety of
      circumstances and considerations, and consequently affords great
      latitude to those who wish to define it precisely and
      comprehensively. <a class="permalink" href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">At present I mean only to consider it as it respects
      security for the preservation of peace and tranquillity, as well
      as against dangers from <em>foreign arms and influence</em>, as
      from dangers of the <em>like kind</em> arising from domestic
      causes. As the former of these comes first in order, it is proper
      it should be the first discussed. Let us therefore proceed to
      examine whether the people are not right in their opinion that a
      cordial Union, under an efficient national government, affords
      them the best security that can be devised against
      <em>hostilities</em> from abroad. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">The number of wars which have happened or will happen
      in the world will always be found to be in proportion to the
      number and weight of the causes, whether <em>real</em> or
      <em>pretended</em>, which <em>provoke</em> or <em>invite</em>
      them. If this remark be just, it becomes useful to inquire whether
      so many <em>just</em> causes of war are likely to be given by
      <em>united America</em> as by <em>disunited</em> America; for if
      it should turn out that United America will probably give the
      fewest, then it will follow that in this respect the Union tends
      most to preserve the people in a state of peace with other
      nations. <a class="permalink" href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">The <em>just</em> causes of war, for the most part,
      arise either from violation of treaties or from direct violence.
      America has already formed treaties with no less than six foreign
      nations, and all of them, except Prussia, are maritime, and
      therefore able to annoy and injure us. She has also extensive
      commerce with Portugal, Spain, and Britain, and, with respect to
      the two latter, has, in addition, the circumstance of neighborhood
      to attend to. <a class="permalink" href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p7">It is of high importance to the peace of America that
      she observe the laws of nations towards all these powers, and to
      me it appears evident that this will be more perfectly and
      punctually done by one national government than it could be either
      by thirteen separate States or by three or four distinct
      confederacies. <a class="permalink" href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p8">Because when once an efficient national government is
      established, the best men in the country will not only consent to
      serve, but also will generally be appointed to manage it; for,
      although town or country, or other contracted influence, may place
      men in State assemblies, or senates, or courts of justice, or
      executive departments, yet more general and extensive reputation
      for talents and other qualifications will be necessary to
      recommend men to offices under the national
      government,&#8212;especially as it will have the widest field for
      choice, and never experience that want of proper persons which is
      not uncommon in some of the States. Hence, it will result that the
      administration, the political counsels, and the judicial decisions
      of the national government will be more wise, systematical, and
      judicious than those of individual States, and consequently more
      satisfactory with respect to other nations, as well as more
      <em>safe</em> with respect to us. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p8">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p9">Because, under the national government, treaties and
      articles of treaties, as well as the laws of nations, will always
      be expounded in one sense and executed in the same
      manner,&#8212;whereas, adjudications on the same points and
      questions, in thirteen States, or in three or four confederacies,
      will not always accord or be consistent; and that, as well from
      the variety of independent courts and judges appointed by
      different and independent governments, as from the different local
      laws and interests which may affect and influence them. The wisdom
      of the convention, in committing such questions to the
      jurisdiction and judgment of courts appointed by and responsible
      only to one national government, cannot be too much commended. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p9">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p10">Because the prospect of present loss or advantage may
      often tempt the governing party in one or two States to swerve
      from good faith and justice; but those temptations, not reaching
      the other States, and consequently having little or no influence
      on the national government, the temptation will be fruitless, and
      good faith and justice be preserved. The case of <a
      href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Paris_Peace_Treaty">the treaty
      of peace with Britain</a> adds great weight to this reasoning. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p10">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p11">Because, even if the governing party in a State should
      be disposed to resist such temptations, yet as such temptations
      may, and commonly do, result from circumstances peculiar to the
      State, and may affect a great number of the inhabitants, the
      governing party may not always be able, if willing, to prevent the
      injustice meditated, or to punish the aggressors. But the national
      government, not being affected by those local circumstances, will
      neither be induced to commit the wrong themselves, nor want power
      or inclination to prevent or punish its commission by others. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p11">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p12">So far, therefore, as either designed or accidental
      violations of treaties and the laws of nations afford
      <em>just</em> causes of war, they are less to be apprehended under
      one general government than under several lesser ones, and in that
      respect the former most favors the <em>safety</em> of the people.
      <a class="permalink" href="#p12">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p13">As to those just causes of war which proceed from
      direct and unlawful violence, it appears equally clear to me that
      one good national government affords vastly more security against
      dangers of that sort than can be derived from any other quarter.
      <a class="permalink" href="#p13">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p14">Because such violences are more frequently caused by
      the passions and interests of a part than of the whole; of one or
      two States than of the Union. Not a single Indian war has yet been
      occasioned by aggressions of the present federal government,
      feeble as it is; but there are several instances of Indian
      hostilities having been provoked by the improper conduct of
      individual States, who, either unable or unwilling to restrain or
      punish offenses, have given occasion to the slaughter of many
      innocent inhabitants. <a class="permalink" href="#p14">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p15">The neighborhood of Spanish and British territories,
      bordering on some States and not on others, naturally confines the
      causes of quarrel more immediately to the borderers. The bordering
      States, if any, will be those who, under the impulse of sudden
      irritation, and a quick sense of apparent interest or injury, will
      be most likely, by direct violence, to excite war with these
      nations; and nothing can so effectually obviate that danger as a
      national government, whose wisdom and prudence will not be
      diminished by the passions which actuate the parties immediately
      interested. <a class="permalink" href="#p15">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p16">But not only fewer just causes of war will be given by
      the national government, but it will also be more in their power
      to accommodate and settle them amicably. They will be more
      temperate and cool, and in that respect, as well as in others,
      will be more in capacity to act advisedly than the offending
      State. The pride of states, as well as of men, naturally disposes
      them to justify all their actions, and opposes their
      acknowledging, correcting, or repairing their errors and offenses.
      The national government, in such cases, will not be affected by
      this pride, but will proceed with moderation and candor to
      consider and decide on the means most proper to extricate them
      from the difficulties which threaten them. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p16">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p17">Besides, it is well known that acknowledgments,
      explanations, and compensations are often accepted as satisfactory
      from a strong united nation, which would be rejected as
      unsatisfactory if offered by a State or confederacy of little
      consideration or power. <a class="permalink" href="#p17">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p18">In the year 1685, the state of Genoa having offended
      Louis XIV, endeavored to appease him. He demanded that they should
      send their <em>Doge</em>, or chief magistrate, accompanied by four
      of their senators, to <em>France</em>, to ask his pardon and
      receive his terms. They were obliged to submit to it for the sake
      of peace. Would he on any occasion either have demanded or have
      received the like humiliation from Spain, or Britain, or any other
      <em>powerful</em> nation? <a class="permalink"
