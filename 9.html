      The Union as a Safeguard Against Domestic Faction and Insurrection
    </h2>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><span class="initial">A firm</span> Union will be of
      the utmost moment to the peace and liberty of the States, as a
      barrier against domestic faction and insurrection. It is
      impossible to read the history of the petty republics of Greece
      and Italy without feeling sensations of horror and disgust at the
      distractions with which they were continually agitated, and at the
      rapid succession of revolutions by which they were kept in a state
      of perpetual vibration between the extremes of tyranny and
      anarchy. If they exhibit occasional calms, these only serve as
      short-lived contrast to the furious storms that are to succeed. If
      now and then intervals of felicity open to view, we behold them
      with a mixture of regret, arising from the reflection that the
      pleasing scenes before us are soon to be overwhelmed by the
      tempestuous waves of sedition and party rage. If momentary rays of
      glory break forth from the gloom, while they dazzle us with a
      transient and fleeting brilliancy, they at the same time admonish
      us to lament that the vices of government should pervert the
      direction and tarnish the lustre of those bright talents and
      exalted endowments for which the favored soils that produced them
      have been so justly celebrated. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">From the disorders that disfigure the annals of those
      republics the advocates of despotism have drawn arguments, not
      only against the forms of republican government, but against the
      very principles of civil liberty. They have decried all free
      government as inconsistent with the order of society, and have
      indulged themselves in malicious exultation over its friends and
      partisans. Happily for mankind, stupendous fabrics reared on the
      basis of liberty, which have flourished for ages, have, in a few
      glorious instances, refuted their gloomy sophisms. And, I trust,
      America will be the broad and solid foundation of other edifices,
      not less magnificent, which will be equally permanent monuments of
      their errors. <a class="permalink" href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">But it is not to be denied that the portraits they have
      sketched of republican government were too just copies of the
      originals from which they were taken. If it had been found
      impracticable to have devised models of a more perfect structure,
      the enlightened friends to liberty would have been obliged to
      abandon the cause of that species of government as indefensible.
      The science of politics, however, like most other sciences, has
      received great improvement. The efficacy of various principles is
      now well understood, which were either not known at all, or
      imperfectly known to the ancients. The regular distribution of
      power into distinct departments; the introduction of legislative
      balances and checks; the institution of courts composed of judges
      holding their offices during good behavior; the representation of
      the people in the legislature by deputies of their own election:
      these are wholly new discoveries, or have made their principal
      progress towards perfection in modern times. They are means, and
      powerful means, by which the excellences of republican government
      may be retained and its imperfections lessened or avoided. To this
      catalogue of circumstances that tend to the amelioration of
      popular systems of civil government, I shall venture, however
      novel it may appear to some, to add one more, on a principle which
      has been made the foundation of an objection to the new
      Constitution; I mean the <em>enlargement</em> of the
      <em>orbit</em> within which such systems are to revolve, either in
      respect to the dimensions of a single State or to the
      consolidation of several smaller States into one great
      Confederacy. The latter is that which immediately concerns the
      object under consideration. It will, however, be of use to examine
      the principle in its application to a single State, which shall be
      attended to in another place. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">The utility of a Confederacy, as well to suppress
      faction and to guard the internal tranquillity of States, as to
      increase their external force and security, is in reality not a
      new idea. It has been practiced upon in different countries and
      ages, and has received the sanction of the most approved writers
      on the subject of politics. The opponents of the plan proposed
      have, with great assiduity, cited and circulated the observations
      of Montesquieu on the necessity of a contracted territory for a
      republican government. But they seem not to have been apprised of
      the sentiments of that great man expressed in another part of his
      work, nor to have adverted to the consequences of the principle to
      which they subscribe with such ready acquiescence. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">When Montesquieu recommends a small extent for
      republics, the standards he had in view were of dimensions far
      short of the limits of almost every one of these States. Neither
      Virginia, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, New York, North Carolina,
      nor Georgia can by any means be compared with the models from
      which he reasoned and to which the terms of his description apply.
      If we therefore take his ideas on this point as the criterion of
      truth, we shall be driven to the alternative either of taking
      refuge at once in the arms of monarchy, or of splitting ourselves
      into an infinity of little, jealous, clashing, tumultuous
      commonwealths, the wretched nurseries of unceasing discord, and
      the miserable objects of universal pity or contempt. Some of the
      writers who have come forward on the other side of the question
      seem to have been aware of the dilemma; and have even been bold
      enough to hint at the division of the larger States as a desirable
      thing. Such an infatuated policy, such a desperate expedient,
      might, by the multiplication of petty offices, answer the views of
      men who possess not qualifications to extend their influence
      beyond the narrow circles of personal intrigue, but it could never
      promote the greatness or happiness of the people of America. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">Referring the examination of the principle itself to
      another place, as has been already mentioned, it will be
      sufficient to remark here that, in the sense of the author who has
      been most emphatically quoted upon the occasion, it would only
      dictate a reduction of the <em>size</em> of the more considerable
      <em>members</em> of the Union, but would not militate against
      their being all comprehended in one confederate government. And
      this is the true question, in the discussion of which we are at
      present interested. <a class="permalink" href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p7">So far are the suggestions of Montesquieu from standing
      in opposition to a general Union of the States, that he explicitly
      treats of a <em>confederate republic</em> as the expedient for
      extending the sphere of popular government, and reconciling the
      advantages of monarchy with those of republicanism. <q>It is very
      probable,</q> (says he<a class="note" href="#note1">1</a>) <q>that
      mankind would have been obliged at length to live constantly under
      the government of a single person, had they not contrived a kind
      of constitution that has all the internal advantages of a
      republican, together with the external force of a monarchical
      government. I mean a <em>confederate republic</em>.</q> <a
      class="permalink" href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

      <blockquote class="flush">
        <p id="p8">&quot;This form of government is a convention by
        which several smaller <em>states</em> agree to become members of
        a larger <em>one</em>, which they intend to form. It is a kind
        of assemblage of societies that constitute a new one, capable of
        increasing, by means of new associations, till they arrive to
        such a degree of power as to be able to provide for the security
        of the united body. <a class="permalink" href="#p8">&#182;</a></p>

        <p id="p9">&quot;A republic of this kind, able to withstand an
        external force, may support itself without any internal
        corruptions. The form of this society prevents all manner of
        inconveniences. <a class="permalink" href="#p9">&#182;</a></p>

        <p id="p10">&quot;If a single member should attempt to usurp the
        supreme authority, he could not be supposed to have an equal
        authority and credit in all the confederate states. Were he to
        have too great influence over one, this would alarm the rest.
        Were he to subdue a part, that which would still remain free
        might oppose him with forces independent of those which he had
        usurped and overpower him before he could be settled in his
        usurpation. <a class="permalink" href="#p10">&#182;</a></p>

        <p id="p11">&quot;Should a popular insurrection happen in one of
        the confederate states the others are able to quell it. Should
        abuses creep into one part, they are reformed by those that
        remain sound. The state may be destroyed on one side, and not on
        the other; the confederacy may be dissolved, and the
        confederates preserve their sovereignty. <a class="permalink"
        href="#p11">&#182;</a></p>

        <p id="p12">&quot;As this government is composed of small
        republics, it enjoys the internal happiness of each; and with
        respect to its external situation, it is possessed, by means of
        the association, of all the advantages of large
        monarchies.&quot; <a class="permalink" href="#p12">&#182;</a></p>
      </blockquote>

      <p id="p13">I have thought it proper to quote at length these
      interesting passages, because they contain a luminous abridgment
      of the principal arguments in favor of the Union, and must
      effectually remove the false impressions which a misapplication of
      other parts of the work was calculated to make. They have, at the
      same time, an intimate connection with the more immediate design
      of this paper; which is, to illustrate the tendency of the Union
      to repress domestic faction and insurrection. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p13">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p14">A distinction, more subtle than accurate, has been
      raised between a <em>confederacy</em> and a <em>consolidation</em>
      of the States. The essential characteristic of the first is said
      to be, the restriction of its authority to the members in their
      collective capacities, without reaching to the individuals of whom
      they are composed. It is contended that the national council ought
      to have no concern with any object of internal administration. An
      exact equality of suffrage between the members has also been
      insisted upon as a leading feature of a confederate government.
      These positions are, in the main, arbitrary; they are supported
      neither by principle nor precedent. It has indeed happened, that
      governments of this kind have generally operated in the manner
      which the distinction taken notice of, supposes to be inherent in
      their nature; but there have been in most of them extensive
      exceptions to the practice, which serve to prove, as far as
      example will go, that there is no absolute rule on the subject.
      And it will be clearly shown in the course of this investigation
      that as far as the principle contended for has prevailed, it has
      been the cause of incurable disorder and imbecility in the
      government. <a class="permalink" href="#p14">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p15">The definition of a <em>confederate republic</em>
      seems simply to be <q>an assemblage of societies,</q> or an
      association of two or more states into one state. The extent,
      modifications, and objects of the federal authority are mere
      matters of discretion. So long as the separate organization of the
      members be not abolished; so long as it exists, by a
      constitutional necessity, for local purposes; though it should be
      in perfect subordination to the general authority of the union, it
      would still be, in fact and in theory, an association of states,
      or a confederacy. The proposed Constitution, so far from implying
      an abolition of the State governments, makes them constituent
      parts of the national sovereignty, by allowing them a direct
      representation in the Senate, and leaves in their possession
      certain exclusive and very important portions of sovereign power.
      This fully corresponds, in every rational import of the terms,
      with the idea of a federal government. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p15">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p16">In the Lycian confederacy, which consisted of
      twenty-three <em>cities</em> or republics, the largest were
      entitled to <em>three</em> votes in the <em>common council</em>,
      those of the middle class to <em>two</em>, and the smallest to
      <em>one</em>. The <em>common council</em> had the appointment of
      all the judges and magistrates of the respective <em>cities</em>.
      This was certainly the most, delicate species of interference in
      their internal administration; for if there be any thing that
      seems exclusively appropriated to the local jurisdictions, it is
      the appointment of their own officers. Yet Montesquieu, speaking
      of this association, says: <q>Were I to give a model of an
      excellent Confederate Republic, it would be that of Lycia.</q>
      Thus we perceive that the distinctions insisted upon were not
      within the contemplation of this enlightened civilian; and we
      shall be led to conclude, that they are the novel refinements of
      an erroneous theory. <a class="permalink" href="#p16">&#182;</a></p>
