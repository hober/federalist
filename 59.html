      Concerning the Power of Congress to Regulate the Election of
      Members
    </h2>

    <div class="entry-content">
      <p id="salutation">To the People of the State of New York:</p>

      <p id="p1"><span class="initial">The</span> natural order of the
      subject leads us to consider, in this place, <a
      href="constitution#a1s4">that provision</a> of the Constitution
      which authorizes the national legislature to regulate, in the last
      resort, the election of its own members. It is in these words: <q
      cite="constitution#a1s4">The <em>Times, Places</em>, and
      <em>Manner</em> of holding Elections for Senators and
      Representatives shall be prescribed in each State by the
      Legislature thereof; but the congress may, at any time, by Law,
      make or alter <em>such Regulations</em>, except as to the
      <em>Places</em> of choosing Senators.</q><a class="note"
      href="#note1">1</a> This provision has not only been declaimed
      against by those who condemn the Constitution in the gross, but it
      has been censured by those who have objected with less latitude
      and greater moderation; and, in one instance it has been thought
      exceptionable by a gentleman who has declared himself the advocate
      of every other part of the system. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p1">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p2">I am greatly mistaken, notwithstanding, if there be any
      article in the whole plan more completely defensible than this.
      Its propriety rests upon the evidence of this plain proposition,
      that <em>every government ought to contain in itself the means of
      its own preservation</em>. Every just reasoner will, at first
      sight, approve an adherence to this rule, in the work of the
      convention; and will disapprove every deviation from it which may
      not appear to have been dictated by the necessity of incorporating
      into the work some particular ingredient, with which a rigid
      conformity to the rule was incompatible. Even in this case, though
      he may acquiesce in the necessity, yet he will not cease to regard
      and to regret a departure from so fundamental a principle, as a
      portion of imperfection in the system which may prove the seed of
      future weakness, and perhaps anarchy. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p2">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p3">It will not be alleged, that an election law could have
      been framed and inserted in the Constitution, which would have
      been always applicable to every probable change in the situation
      of the country; and it will therefore not be denied, that a
      discretionary power over elections ought to exist somewhere. It
      will, I presume, be as readily conceded, that there were only
      three ways in which this power could have been reasonably modified
      and disposed: that it must either have been lodged wholly in the
      national legislature, or wholly in the State legislatures, or
      primarily in the latter and ultimately in the former. The last
      mode has, with reason, been preferred by the convention. They have
      submitted the regulation of elections for the federal government,
      in the first instance, to the local administrations; which, in
      ordinary cases, and when no improper views prevail, may be both
      more convenient and more satisfactory; but they have reserved to
      the national authority a right to interpose, whenever
      extraordinary circumstances might render that interposition
      necessary to its safety. <a class="permalink" href="#p3">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p4">Nothing can be more evident, than that an exclusive
      power of regulating elections for the national government, in the
      hands of the State legislatures, would leave the existence of the
      Union entirely at their mercy. They could at any moment annihilate
      it, by neglecting to provide for the choice of persons to
      administer its affairs. It is to little purpose to say, that a
      neglect or omission of this kind would not be likely to take
      place. The constitutional possibility of the thing, without an
      equivalent for the risk, is an unanswerable objection. Nor has any
      satisfactory reason been yet assigned for incurring that risk. The
      extravagant surmises of a distempered jealousy can never be
      dignified with that character. If we are in a humor to presume
      abuses of power, it is as fair to presume them on the part of the
      State governments as on the part of the general government. And as
      it is more consonant to the rules of a just theory, to trust the
      Union with the care of its own existence, than to transfer that
      care to any other hands, if abuses of power are to be hazarded on
      the one side or on the other, it is more rational to hazard them
      where the power would naturally be placed, than where it would
      unnaturally be placed. <a class="permalink" href="#p4">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p5">Suppose an article had been introduced into the
      Constitution, empowering the United States to regulate the
      elections for the particular States, would any man have hesitated
      to condemn it, both as an unwarrantable transposition of power,
      and as a premeditated engine for the destruction of the State
      governments? The violation of principle, in this case, would have
      required no comment; and, to an unbiased observer, it will not be
      less apparent in the project of subjecting the existence of the
      national government, in a similar respect, to the pleasure of the
      State governments. An impartial view of the matter cannot fail to
      result in a conviction, that each, as far as possible, ought to
      depend on itself for its own preservation. <a class="permalink"
      href="#p5">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p6">As an objection to this position, it may be remarked
      that the constitution of the national Senate would involve, in its
      full extent, the danger which it is suggested might flow from an
      exclusive power in the State legislatures to regulate the federal
      elections. It may be alleged, that by declining the appointment of
      Senators, they might at any time give a fatal blow to the Union;
      and from this it may be inferred, that as its existence would be
      thus rendered dependent upon them in so essential a point, there
      can be no objection to intrusting them with it in the particular
      case under consideration. The interest of each State, it may be
      added, to maintain its representation in the national councils,
      would be a complete security against an abuse of the trust. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p6">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p7">This argument, though specious, will not, upon
      examination, be found solid. It is certainly true that the State
      legislatures, by forbearing the appointment of senators, may
      destroy the national government. But it will not follow that,
      because they have a power to do this in one instance, they ought
      to have it in every other. There are cases in which the pernicious
      tendency of such a power may be far more decisive, without any
      motive equally cogent with that which must have regulated the
      conduct of the convention in respect to the formation of the
      Senate, to recommend their admission into the system. So far as
      that construction may expose the Union to the possibility of
      injury from the State legislatures, it is an evil; but it is an
      evil which could not have been avoided without excluding the
      States, in their political capacities, wholly from a place in the
      organization of the national government. If this had been done, it
      would doubtless have been interpreted into an entire dereliction
      of the federal principle; and would certainly have deprived the
      State governments of that absolute safeguard which they will enjoy
      under this provision. But however wise it may have been to have
      submitted in this instance to an inconvenience, for the attainment
      of a necessary advantage or a greater good, no inference can be
      drawn from thence to favor an accumulation of the evil, where no
      necessity urges, nor any greater good invites. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p7">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p8">It may be easily discerned also that the national
      government would run a much greater risk from a power in the State
      legislatures over the elections of its House of Representatives,
      than from their power of appointing the members of its Senate. The
      senators are to be chosen for the period of six years; there is to
      be a rotation, by which the seats of a third part of them are to
      be vacated and replenished every two years; and no State is to be
      entitled to more than two senators; a quorum of the body is to
      consist of sixteen members. The joint result of these
      circumstances would be, that a temporary combination of a few
      States to intermit the appointment of senators, could neither
      annul the existence nor impair the activity of the body; and it is
      not from a general and permanent combination of the States that we
      can have any thing to fear. The first might proceed from sinister
      designs in the leading members of a few of the State legislatures;
      the last would suppose a fixed and rooted disaffection in the
      great body of the people, which will either never exist at all, or
      will, in all probability, proceed from an experience of the
      inaptitude of the general government to the advancement of their
      happiness in which event no good citizen could desire its
      continuance. <a class="permalink" href="#p8">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p9">But with regard to the federal House of
      Representatives, there is intended to be a general election of
      members once in two years. If the State legislatures were to be
      invested with an exclusive power of regulating these elections,
      every period of making them would be a delicate crisis in the
      national situation, which might issue in a dissolution of the
      Union, if the leaders of a few of the most important States should
      have entered into a previous conspiracy to prevent an election. <a
      class="permalink" href="#p9">&#182;</a></p>

      <p id="p10">I shall not deny, that there is a degree of weight in
      the observation, that the interests of each State, to be
      represented in the federal councils, will be a security against
      the abuse of a power over its elections in the hands of the State
      legislatures. But the security will not be considered as complete,
      by those who attend to the force of an obvious distinction between
      the interest of the people in the public felicity, and the
      interest of their local rulers in the power and consequence of
      their offices. The people of America may be warmly attached to the
      government of the Union, at times when the particular rulers of
      particular States, stimulated by the natural rivalship of power,
      and by the hopes of personal aggrandizement, and supported by a
      strong faction in each of those States, may be in a very opposite
      temper. This diversity of sentiment between a majority of the
      people, and the individuals who have the greatest credit in their
      councils, is exemplified in some of the States at the present
      moment, on the present question. The scheme of separate
      confederacies, which will always nultiply the chances of ambition,
      will be a never failing bait to all such influential characters in
      the State administrations as are capable of preferring their own
      emolument and advancement to the public weal. With so effectual a
      weapon in their hands as the exclusive power of regulating
      elections for the national government, a combination of a few such
      men, in a few of the most considerable States, where the
      temptation will always be the strongest, might accomplish the
      destruction of the Union, by seizing the opportunity of some
      casual dissatisfaction among the people (and which perhaps they
      may themselves have excited), to discontinue the choice of members
      for the federal House of Representatives. It ought never to be
      forgotten, that a firm union of this country, under an efficient
      government, will probably be an increasing object of jealousy to
      more than one nation of Europe; and that enterprises to subvert it
      will sometimes originate in the intrigues of foreign powers, and
      will seldom fail to be patronized and abetted by some of them. Its
      preservation, therefore ought in no case that can be avoided, to
      be committed to the guardianship of any but those whose situation
      will uniformly beget an immediate interest in the faithful and
      vigilant performance of the trust. <a class="permalink"
